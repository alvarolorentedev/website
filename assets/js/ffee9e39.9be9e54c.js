With the abundance of API management tools and frameworks available, it is relatively straightforward to expose a set of functionality as an API and make it available to other systems. This has led to a proliferation of APIs, many of which are redundant or unnecessary, adding unnecessary complexity to the overall system."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Another issue is the lack of standardization in the API ecosystem. Each API is typically designed to meet the specific needs of the system it was created for, resulting in a wide variety of different designs and conventions.
