### The Team Level


Decisions at the team level often involve immediate, tactical issues related to required execution, technology choices, or problem-solving methods. 


> **Empower your teams** by encouraging autonomy and ownership of decisions within their scope. 


Implement a **decentralized decision-making process**, where the teams and its members can make decisions based on their expertise and understanding of the context. This approach enhances agility and accelerates the development process. 
However, ensure these decisions align with broader domain and departmental goals through regular sync-ups and transparent communication channels.

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Action Steps** | 1. **Set Clear Objectives**: Begin by clearly defining the problem or topic you're brainstorming about. Ensure everyone understands the goal of the session.
2. **Create a Conducive Environment:** Choose a comfortable setting free from distractions. A relaxed atmosphere encourages more open and creative thinking.
3. **Encourage Uninhibited Participation:** 
  - Emphasize that all ideas are welcome, no matter how outlandish they may seem.
  - Encourage participants to build on or combine ideas from others.
  - Avoid criticism or evaluation of ideas during the brainstorming phase to keep the flow of ideas going.
4. **Use a Visual Aid**: Write down ideas on a whiteboard, flip chart, or shared document visible to all participants. This helps keep track of the ideas generated and can inspire further thoughts.
5. **Timebox the Session**: Set a clear time limit for the brainstorming session (e.g., 15-30 minutes). This creates a sense of urgency and helps maintain focus.
6. **Facilitate the Session**: Have a facilitator guide the session to ensure everyone has a chance to contribute. The facilitator can also help keep the session on track and encourage quieter members to share their ideas.
7. **Review and Prioritize**: Once the brainstorming phase is complete, review the ideas as a group. You can discuss, combine, or refine ideas and prioritize them based on criteria relevant to your objectives.
8. **Plan Next Steps**: Decide on actionable steps to explore or implement the top ideas. Assign responsibilities and deadlines as needed. |


### The Domain Level


Domain-level decisions impact a specific area of expertise within the engineering department, requiring a blend of technical knowledge and strategic foresight. These decisions might involve adopting new technologies, architectural changes, or methodologies that affect how projects within the domain are executed. 


> Engage **cross-functional teams** in these discussions to gather diverse perspectives and ensure the decision supports both engineering & product goals. 


One framework that can be used is **RFCs (Request for Comments)** documents, as they help to build consensus and will become part of your historical knowledge base.  You can start using it by following the next process:

- **Define the RFC Process**: Clarify who can submit, the format/template, the review process, and decision-making criteria.
- **Submission and Publication**: Make the RFC accessible to all stakeholders through a shared system or platform.
- **Feedback and Discussion**: Allow a set period for stakeholders to provide feedback and engage in discussions to refine the proposal.
- **Decision-Making**: After feedback, decision-makers approve, request revisions, or reject the RFC, communicating the decision clearly.
- **Implementation**: Approved RFCs are added to the project roadmap or backlog for execution.
- **Review and Retrospective**: Post-implementation, review the outcomes and conduct a retrospective to improve future RFC processes.

## Decision Alignment 


Aligning decisions across multiple levels within an organization is a critical challenge that requires a structured approach to ensure coherence and efficiency. As organizations grow and become more complex, the need for clear communication and defined roles becomes paramount to avoid confusion and ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals. 
A key strategy in achieving this alignment is to ensure that decision-making processes are transparent and involve the right stakeholders at the right time. This involves not only identifying who needs to be involved in making decisions but also clarifying the extent of their involvement and the expectations from them. 
Effective alignment means that strategic decisions made at the top level are informed by insights from all relevant parts of the organization and that these decisions are effectively communicated and implemented at the operational level.

| **Action Steps** | 1. **Identify Tasks and Processes:** List all tasks, activities, or decisions that need to be made within the department. This creates the foundation for assigning responsibilities.
2. **Determine the Participants:** Identify all individuals and teams involved. This includes anyone who will perform tasks, make decisions, or needs to be kept informed.
3. **Create the RACI Chart:** Set up a matrix with tasks or decisions on one axis and the participants on the other. Fill in the matrix with R, A, C, or I to define the role of each participant for each task:
  - **Responsible (R)**: Who is responsible for executing.
  - **Accountable (A)**: Who is ultimately accountable for the completion and success of the task. Typically, this is one person.
  - **Consulted (C)**: Who needs to be consulted or involved in the decision-making process because of their expertise or input.
  - **Informed (I)**: Who needs to be informed about the task's progress or decisions. |
