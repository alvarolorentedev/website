            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last months, I've witnessed firsthand the transformation of my team from a basic operation provider to an internal service provider. </p><p>In many organizations, systems operations teams are often segmented into specialized units such as DBA, backend operations, networking, etc. While this specialization ensures deep expertise and support to teams in complex situations. It also leads to inefficiencies as it focuses on the reactiveness to the needs of the teams &amp; company and not a proactive approach towards the same long-term needs due to the lack of common vision. It also has the drawback that enforces the dev vs ops culture and not a DevOps culture that has shown over and over again the positive effect on quality and speed of delivery of stream-aligned teams.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="devops-or-dev-vs-ops">’DevOps’ or ‘Dev vs Ops’<a class="hash-link" href="#devops-or-dev-vs-ops" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Traditionally, Dev and Ops teams have operated in silos, each with their own distinct goals and priorities. </p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Focus</th><th><strong>Priorities</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Dev Culture</strong></td><td>Development teams are primarily focused on creating new features, writing code, and ensuring the software meets user requirements.</td><td>Speed and innovation</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ops Culture</strong></td><td>Operations teams are responsible for maintaining the stability, security, and performance of the software in production environments.</td><td>Reliability and uptime</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This separation can lead to several challenges:</p><ul><li><strong>Communication Barriers:</strong>&nbsp;Lack of communication between Dev and Ops can result in misunderstandings and delays. Developers may not fully understand the operational constraints, while Ops may struggle with the rapid pace of development.</li><li><strong>Conflicting Goals:</strong>&nbsp;Developers prioritize speed and innovation, while Ops prioritize stability and reliability. These conflicting goals can create friction and hinder collaboration.</li><li><strong>Inefficiencies:</strong>&nbsp;Siloed teams often duplicate efforts and use different tools, leading to inefficiencies and wasted resources.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-devops-solution"><strong>The DevOps Solution</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#the-devops-solution" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The goal of DevOps is to create a culture of ownership to stream aligned teams to do development and operations, breaking down traditional silos and fostering a more integrated approach to software delivery. While the existing operations teams become a provider of abstractions that simplifies that work, reducing the cognitive load of operating the system.</p><p>This brings the next benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Enhanced Collaboration:</strong>&nbsp;Breaking down silos fosters a culture of collaboration, enabling teams to work together more effectively and share knowledge.</li><li><strong>Improved Efficiency:</strong>&nbsp;Streamlined workflows and standardized tools reduce redundancy and improve operational efficiency.</li><li><strong>Greater Innovation:</strong>&nbsp;A unified approach allows teams to quickly adapt to new technologies and methodologies, driving innovation and continuous improvement.</li><li><strong>Customer-Centric Approach:</strong>&nbsp;By aligning development and operations goals, teams can better understand and meet the needs of end-users, resulting in higher customer satisfaction.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-birth-of-the-platform-team">The Birth of the Platform Team<a class="hash-link" href="#the-birth-of-the-platform-team" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>A platform team acts as a service provider for all internal stream-aligned teams, offering essential tools, infrastructure, and support to streamline their work and enhance productivity. We could start enumerating systems and solutions that a platform team can own. But the reality is that would be the same as creating a product without doing any research on your clients.</p><p>To truly drive value within an organization, a platform team must deeply understand and address the needs of stream-aligned teams. These teams are directly responsible for delivering products and services to customers, and their success hinges on the support and resources provided by the platform team. Here’s how a platform team can effectively drive value by focusing on the needs of stream-aligned teams:</p><ul><li><strong>Active Engagement and Communication:</strong>&nbsp;work collaboratively with stream-aligned teams to develop solutions that address their specific pain points, fostering a sense of shared responsibility and mutual support.</li><li><strong>Continuous Improvement and Innovation:</strong>&nbsp;Implement iterative development practices to continuously refine and improve tools and services.</li><li><strong>Metrics and Performance Tracking:</strong>&nbsp;Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of the platform team’s support and use data-driven approaches to make informed decisions about resource allocation and process improvements.</li><li><strong>Empowerment and Autonomy:</strong>&nbsp;Develop self-service platforms that empower stream-aligned teams to manage their own resources and workflows, and provide comprehensive training and support to ensure proficiency in using the tools and services offered by the platform team.</li></ul><p><strong>The key benefits this strategy tries to achieve are:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Efficiency:</strong>&nbsp;By centralizing infrastructure management, tooling, and support, the platform team reduces redundancy and improves operational efficiency. Stream-aligned teams can focus on delivering value to customers without worrying about underlying infrastructure.</li><li><strong>Consistency:</strong>&nbsp;Standardized tools and processes ensure consistency across the organization, making it easier to manage and scale applications.</li><li><strong>Reliability:</strong>&nbsp;A dedicated platform team ensures that the infrastructure is reliable and secure, minimizing downtime and enhancing the overall stability of applications.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts<a class="hash-link" href="#closing-thoughts" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>By fostering a culture of ownership and collaboration, and by providing abstractions that simplify operations, the platform team can significantly reduce the cognitive load on stream-aligned teams. This transformation brings enhanced collaboration, improved efficiency, greater innovation, and a customer-centric approach, ultimately driving the success of the organization.</p><p>As we continue to evolve, the key to driving value lies in deeply understanding and addressing the needs of stream-aligned teams. Through active engagement, continuous improvement, metrics tracking, and empowerment, the platform team can ensure that stream-aligned teams are equipped to deliver exceptional products and services to our customers. This strategy not only centralizes infrastructure management and standardizes tools but also ensures reliability and consistency across the organization, paving the way for sustained growth and success.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It involves sharing information, explaining decisions, and being clear about expectations and goals. This openness builds trust, fosters a culture of accountability, and encourages open communication.</p><p>When leaders are transparent, they create an environment where team members feel valued and respected. They know that their leaders are not hiding anything from them and that they can rely on the information provided. This helps to:</p><ul><li><strong>Building Trust and Credibility:</strong> Trust is not something that can be demanded; it must be earned. By being transparent, you demonstrate integrity and honesty, which are crucial for building credibility.</li><li><strong>Encouraging Open Communication:</strong> When team members see that their leaders are open and honest, they are more likely to reciprocate. This creates a culture where everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas, concerns, and feedback.</li><li><strong>Fostering Accountability:</strong> When you are open about your own performance and hold yourself accountable for your actions, you encourage your team to do the same. This culture of accountability leads to higher performance and continuous improvement.</li><li><strong>Enhancing Employee Morale and Engagement:</strong> Employees who work in a transparent environment are generally more satisfied and engaged. They appreciate knowing that their leaders are honest and forthcoming, which creates a sense of security and belonging. When employees feel informed and included in the decision-making process, they are more likely to be committed to the organization's mission and values.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transparency-in-a-healthy-chain-of-command"><strong>Transparency in a Healthy Chain of Command</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#transparency-in-a-healthy-chain-of-command" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>A healthy chain of command relies heavily on transparency. In a transparent organization, information flows freely up and down the hierarchy. Leaders at all levels are open about their decisions, goals, and challenges, which ensures that everyone is aligned and working towards the same objectives.</p><p>When transparency is lacking, it can lead to misunderstandings, mistrust, and a breakdown in communication. Team members may feel left out of the loop, leading to disengagement and decreased morale. On the other hand, a transparent chain of command fosters a sense of unity and collaboration, as everyone is aware of their roles and how they contribute to the organization's success.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-importance-of-avoiding-secrecy-in-strategic-decisions"><strong>The Importance of Avoiding Secrecy in Strategic Decisions</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#the-importance-of-avoiding-secrecy-in-strategic-decisions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>While there are instances where strategic secrecy is necessary, it's equally important to recognize the potential downsides of keeping strategic decisions hidden from your team. Transparency in strategic decision-making can significantly enhance trust, engagement, and overall organizational performance. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/df75203e-cd58-41eb-8339-d5bf4288eb0e/c4f8e2a4-13c8-4265-9de2-068dd8950a51/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LB4667NHSBZZO%2F20250731%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20250731T115508Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEKv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQD9to3uKVVkQLmoLUIA2bPBcwDtiPa6p%2FcroWa7eX1rxwIhAK99TsL8ZE0tozeB48uYo990gWYRDSVBuxyYUW7Ow0AvKogECNT%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMNjM3NDIzMTgzODA1IgwQdNMmozzhImGCSnUq3AN3y4o%2BV1sT4ZgeysCyaKrqIdzo9qsQaoiHFq1zTpT6saR9QO2RY3IPPpfuab6xf58LfrZYbL9AjMQEdZbMBQA%2FdnKrzxPeCOA%2FPqeUwhpSal1aq9GCKglfCjIcGkyyZJPPNqh6UkmgP1MJPI2VmX%2BaBbRavM8wplpGudxzBnbAgX6kB6AIu2A%2BiQ34CzPC5T5VE%2F2aFCXF8suWrgXZKhmtm8Sc4yBNS15qt4qOLgQsaKw3Oi1lqZixb0W91RffS0Z2A42PgDRXrF430MxXyietmnxdFNmNfDyUNFnq7Y8g2DCHFn7ESzGPq6mi%2BmmgD%2BbvhjfkPAW%2FwgQaIWDjcW4dNS92xDtcmt3G0yDkTDwZD5Z%2F0aw7a%2Fw8hBcPTp3rNTxp0Gn%2BbOzWzVj8uY%2F1%2BcZ7laVtXy%2Fb3ZLRLhS5WjC4Sen9SSWbThy2qbMISVxin1r89TTcFq0nvSJB3kz1BW10Dn7EE6tUQiK80xGdOzM3yQrmvHt5Xhq%2BOTHJlZ7m3KYzJPt3q%2FnSPag72Szs2yAeBh43pHsnl1Oi2EnKZWMtaxpVDiEh8BNdX99nepXUqFosgnWntPWqGUgPBAFBUA73V0Xfe4M54z5eiXliHg15ofQONgdTe4EJD0FWZzD4nK3EBjqkAdmS7BdzugaH0RZswP114eb09GXlStUahSMuGyYggLCXCpFQsld3tvZeyorNiD2m5BJKtO8ZO8uDQqOVJXV0TtKq%2BkdDKyjee092C0CY7VoWsqvhqA9jJiLfAAcRouB%2FHlZJ2n2izduaLRjvaEQt0QAFAyf7BFHoRl%2FL8p3gsbfhIAI8fBv%2F7r5voAKVsY2M3xLRnG%2B8IoFekxjTQkMTX6dUsgXJ&amp;X-Amz-Signature=7f69bfc4cefc7281b2f294d1221d5686f55aa8958fbe41724032bec35d5b3a82&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&amp;x-id=GetObject" alt="image.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Here’s why avoiding secrecy in strategic decisions is crucial:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Enhancing Trust and Engagement:</strong> When leaders are transparent about strategic decisions, it builds trust within the team. Employees feel valued and respected when they are kept in the loop about the direction of the organization. This trust fosters a sense of ownership and commitment, leading to higher levels of engagement and motivation. Research has shown that organizations with high levels of trust and transparency tend to have more engaged employees, which directly correlates with improved performance and lower turnover rates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Improving Decision Quality:</strong> Transparency in strategic decision-making encourages diverse perspectives and input from various levels of the organization. When employees are aware of the strategic direction and the reasons behind it, they can provide valuable insights and feedback that might not have been considered otherwise. This collaborative approach leads to more informed and well-rounded decisions, ultimately benefiting the organization.</p><p>For example, a study by Harvard Business Review found that companies that involve employees in strategic planning processes are more likely to achieve their goals and adapt to changes effectively. By avoiding secrecy, leaders can tap into the collective intelligence of their team, leading to better outcomes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Preventing Misinformation and Rumors:</strong> Secrecy can often lead to misinformation and rumors, which can be detrimental to organizational morale and cohesion. When employees are left in the dark, they may speculate and create their own narratives, which can lead to confusion and mistrust. By being transparent about strategic decisions, leaders can ensure that accurate information is disseminated, reducing the likelihood of rumors and fostering a more cohesive and informed team.</p></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In conclusion, transparency is a cornerstone of effective leadership and a healthy chain of command. By being open and honest, leaders can build trust, encourage open communication, foster accountability, enhance employee morale, and drive organizational success. As you aspire to take on leadership roles, remember that transparency is not just a strategy; it's a commitment to creating a positive and thriving workplace culture.</p><p>Embrace transparency, and you'll be well on your way to becoming a trusted and effective leader.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear readers, I am back. I apologize for the hiatus, it has been a few “interesting” months in my life that have made me reflect a lot on some topics that before I thought were trivial, and one-sided. I will try to share some thoughts over the next few posts. So let's start with a subject that is really fresh in my mind, as it's what has been affecting me over the last few months.</p><p>To the question “During your career, did to pass a Job trial period?” the most common answer will be “Yes”. Traditionally, it is viewed as a tool for employers to evaluate potential hires, nevertheless it's crucial to recognize that these periods serve a dual purpose. They are, in fact, a two-way street that benefits both employers and employees alike.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-in-for-us">What is in for Us?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-in-for-us" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The trial period is an evaluation period, it can even be seen as an extension of the interview process, as you will never get to know a person you will spend most of your awake workday day with.</p><p>With this in mind, the same as in interview, we need to remember is not a one-sided evaluation, Employers should evaluate ROI &amp; employees should evaluate company fitness.</p><p>From an <strong>employer's standpoint</strong>, trial periods offer several advantages:</p><ul><li><strong>Skill Assessment:</strong> Employers can evaluate a candidate's practical skills and how they apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios.</li><li><strong>Cultural Fit:</strong> It provides an opportunity to assess how well the new hire integrates with the existing team and company culture.</li><li><strong>Performance Evaluation:</strong> Employers can gauge the employee's productivity, work ethic, and ability to meet deadlines.</li><li><strong>Risk Mitigation:</strong> If the employee doesn't meet expectations, the company can part ways with minimal legal and financial implications.</li></ul><p>Equally important, but often overlooked, is the <strong>employee's perspective</strong> on trial periods:</p><ul><li><strong>Company Culture Experience:</strong> Employees can immerse themselves in the company culture and determine if it aligns with their values and work style.</li><li><strong>Job Satisfaction Assessment:</strong> It allows individuals to evaluate if the role meets their expectations and career aspirations.</li><li><strong>Team Dynamics:</strong> Employees can assess how well they work with their colleagues and immediate supervisors.</li><li><strong>Work-Life Balance:</strong> The trial period offers insight into the company's approach to work-life balance and flexibility</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="maximizing-the-trial-period">Maximizing the Trial Period<a class="hash-link" href="#maximizing-the-trial-period" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>To make the most of a job trial period, both parties should approach it with openness and clear communication:</p><ul><li><strong>Set Clear Expectations:</strong> Employers should outline specific goals and performance metrics for the trial period.</li><li><strong>Regular Feedback:</strong> Implement a system for frequent, two-way feedback to address concerns and acknowledge progress.</li><li><strong>Encourage Questions:</strong> Create an environment where the new hire feels comfortable asking questions and seeking clarification.</li><li><strong>Provide Necessary Resources:</strong> Ensure the employee has all the tools and information needed to perform their job effectively.</li></ul><p>To achieve this, we need to use the correct tools for the job</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="onboarding-plan">Onboarding Plan<a class="hash-link" href="#onboarding-plan" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>An effective onboarding plan should contain:</p><ul><li><strong>Comprehensive introduction:</strong> Include an overview of the company's culture, policies, and procedures.</li><li><strong>Role-specific training:</strong> Provide training tailored to the new employee's specific job responsibilities.</li><li><strong>Introduction to team and colleagues:</strong> Facilitate meetings with team members and key personnel.</li><li><strong>Resource provision:</strong> Ensure the employee has all necessary tools and information to perform their job effectively.</li><li><strong>Assign a buddy</strong>: pair the employee with a more experienced colleague who can provide informal guidance and support that can help navigate the day-to-day aspects of the job.</li><li><strong>Assign a mentor</strong>: pair the employee mentor is usually a more senior employee who can provide guidance, share industry insights, and help them grow in their role over a longer period.</li><li><strong>Regular feedback sessions:</strong> as a manager, schedule frequent check-ins to address concerns and acknowledge progress.</li></ul><p>A well-structured onboarding plan helps new employees quickly integrate into their roles and the organization, reducing the learning curve and increasing productivity during the trial period.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="30-60-90-plan">30-60-90 Plan<a class="hash-link" href="#30-60-90-plan" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A 30-60-90 plan is a strategic framework used for onboarding new employees or setting goals for the first 90 days in a new role.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever considered the various types of tasks within a team? Why do we often separate tasks into 'technical' and 'product' categories? Is this division a reality, or is it simply a reflection of our difficulty in articulating the value of non-functional behavior?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-current-concept-of-technical-task">The Current Concept of Technical Task<a class="hash-link" href="#the-current-concept-of-technical-task" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Technical tasks are typically considered those that involve the underlying work on non-functional related endeavors. These can include activities like updating dependencies, improving performance, etc.
While they may not always have a direct visible impact on the end user, In reality, almost every task a development team undertakes has some level of impact on the product. Even tasks perceived as purely technical, such as improving code quality or optimizing performance, ultimately contribute to a better user experience and product reliability. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="understanding-the-net-value-of-tasks">Understanding the Net Value of Tasks<a class="hash-link" href="#understanding-the-net-value-of-tasks" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>Any team effort needs to have a clear purpose, whether it's technical or product-related. </p></blockquote><p>IIf we approach our work with the previous quote in mind, any endeavor a team undertakes should yield a positive return on investment. Let's express this value as a simple formula:</p><p>$ = Value - Cost</p><p>where:</p><ul><li><strong>Value</strong>: The benefit or worth that a task or project brings to the organization, often measured in terms of revenue.</li><li><strong>Cost</strong>: The amount of resources, including time, money, and effort, required to complete a task or project.</li></ul><p>It's normally simpler to calculate the expected value of functional tasks because their impact on user experience and business metrics is more direct and measurable. However, even technical tasks, when evaluated through this lens, can reveal significant contributions to the product's overall value.</p><p>The benefit we will achieve from this approach is a more cohesive and efficient development process, where all tasks are recognized for their contribution to the product's success. This integrated approach to task management allows for more strategic prioritization. When all tasks are evaluated based on their potential impact on the product, teams can make more informed decisions about where to allocate their resources. This can result in more timely delivery of features and improvements, better risk management, and a more adaptable development process.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="example-of-task-calculations">Example of Task Calculations<a class="hash-link" href="#example-of-task-calculations" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="functional-task-adding-a-new-feature">Functional Task: Adding a New Feature<a class="hash-link" href="#functional-task-adding-a-new-feature" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><strong>Task</strong>: Implement a new user login feature.</p><ul><li><strong>Value</strong>: This feature is expected to increase user sign-ups by 5%, leading to an estimated increase in revenue of $5,000 per month.</li><li><strong>Cost</strong>: The development team estimates that it will take a week to complete this task (around 40 hours). Assuming an average hourly rate of $50, the total cost is $2,000.</li></ul><p><strong>$ Value Calculation</strong>:
$ = Value - Cost</p><p>$ = $5,000 - $2,000</p><p>$ = $3,000 per month</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="non-functional-task-performance-improvements">Non-Functional Task: Performance Improvements<a class="hash-link" href="#non-functional-task-performance-improvements" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><strong>Task</strong>: Optimize the application's performance to reduce load times and enhance user experience.</p><ul><li><strong>Value</strong>: Faster load times are expected to improve user retention by 15%, leading to an estimated increase in paid users and an additional revenue of $7,000 per month.</li><li><strong>Cost</strong>: The development team estimates that it will take 50 hours to complete this task.

$ = Value - Cost</p><p>$ = $7,000 - $2,500</p><p>$ = $4,500 per month</p><p>With these examples in mind, it makes more sense to start with performance improvements and not working on the functional task.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="embrace-a-unified-approach-to-task-management">Embrace a Unified Approach to Task Management<a class="hash-link" href="#embrace-a-unified-approach-to-task-management" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>To truly integrate technical and product tasks, teams should adopt a unified approach to task management. This involves recognizing that every task, no matter how technical it may seem, plays a crucial role in the overall product vision. Here are some additional strategies to ensure this integration:</p><ol><li><strong>Unified Backlog</strong>: Maintain a single backlog that includes both product features and technical tasks. This ensures that all tasks are visible to the entire team and can be prioritized based on their overall impact on the product.</li><li><strong>Cross-functional Teams</strong>: Foster cross-functional teams where developers, product managers, and other stakeholders work closely together. This can help bridge the gap between technical and product perspectives, leading to more informed decision-making.</li><li><strong>Regular Reviews</strong>: Conduct regular reviews of the backlog and ongoing tasks to ensure that technical debt is being addressed, and that product features are aligned with technical improvements.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts<a class="hash-link" href="#final-thoughts" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In conclusion, the distinction between technical and product tasks is often more conceptual than practical. By recognizing the interdependence of these tasks and integrating them into a unified development process, teams can enhance both product quality and development efficiency. It's time to stop segregating tasks and start viewing them as integral parts of a cohesive product development strategy. This holistic approach will improve the end product and foster a more collaborative and productive team environment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Learn how queuing theory impacts productivity, the adverse effects of long-term high utilization, and strategies to maintain a balanced, efficient, and creative development team.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been almost a year since McKinsey released their developer productivity approach. While I fully disagree with their ideas, it highlights the ongoing interest of companies in continuously improving per-developer productivity.</p><p>Regardless of whether you work within an agile or non-agile framework, most teams seem unable to complete the assigned work for each cycle. This indicates that we are maximizing utilization.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-queuing-theory-behind-work">The Queuing Theory Behind Work<a class="hash-link" href="#the-queuing-theory-behind-work" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As work is a continuous stream of requests, it typically takes the form of a waiting queue and is governed by its principles. This is why queuing theory helps us understand how tasks accumulate and how delays can propagate through the system. By analyzing the flow of tasks and identifying bottlenecks, we can better manage workloads and improve efficiency.</p><p>Here are two formulas that actually drive the entire system:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="kingmans-formula">Kingman's Formula<a class="hash-link" href="#kingmans-formula" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Kingman's Formula, also known as the VUT equation, is a widely used approximation in queuing theory. It helps estimate the average waiting time in a queue. The formula is given by:</p><p>[<!-- --> W_q \approx \frac{VUT}{1-U} <!-- -->]</p><p>Where:</p><ul><li>(<!-- --> W_q <!-- -->)<!-- --> is the average waiting time in the queue.</li><li>(<!-- --> V <!-- -->)<!-- --> is the variability of inter-arrival and service times.</li><li>(<!-- --> U <!-- -->)<!-- --> is the utilization factor (the ratio of arrival rate to service rate).</li><li>(<!-- --> T <!-- -->)<!-- --> is the average service time.</li></ul><p>Kingman's Formula highlights the impact of variability and utilization on waiting times. As utilization approaches 100%, waiting times increase dramatically, which is why it's crucial to avoid overloading systems.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="littles-law">Little's Law<a class="hash-link" href="#littles-law" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Little's Law is a fundamental theorem in queuing theory that relates the average number of items in a queue (L), the average arrival rate of items (λ), and the average time an item spends in the system (W). The law is expressed as:</p><p>[<!-- --> L = \lambda W <!-- -->]</p><p>Where:</p><ul><li>(<!-- --> L <!-- -->)<!-- --> is the average number of items in the system.</li><li>(<!-- --> \lambda <!-- -->)<!-- --> is the average arrival rate of items.</li><li>(<!-- --> W <!-- -->)<!-- --> is the average time an item spends in the system.</li></ul><p>Little's Law is useful for understanding and managing queues in various contexts, including software development. It implies that to reduce the number of tasks in progress (L), you can either decrease the arrival rate of tasks (λ) or reduce the time tasks spend in the system (W). This principle supports the idea of not overloading development teams and allowing adequate time for tasks to be completed efficiently.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="effects-of-100-long-term--utilization">Effects of +100% Long-Term  Utilization<a class="hash-link" href="#effects-of-100-long-term--utilization" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>There are many systems that follow these principles, allowing us to observe the long-term effects on both human and non-human systems. Spoiler alert: they are quite similar.</p><p>For example, when a CPU or any other system is used at 100% for extended periods or overclocked beyond its standard limits, several adverse effects can occur:</p><ol><li><strong>Heat Generation</strong>: High utilization and overclocking increase the CPU's heat output. Excessive heat can lead to thermal throttling, reducing performance, and in extreme cases, hardware damage.</li><li><strong>Reduced Lifespan</strong>: Constant high usage or overclocking can shorten the CPU's lifespan. Increased electrical stress and heat degrade the CPU's materials over time.</li><li><strong>System Instability</strong>: Overclocking can cause crashes, freezes, and unexpected reboots. Even at 100% utilization, a system can become unresponsive if it lacks resources.</li><li><strong>Increased Power Consumption</strong>: High utilization and overclocking lead to higher power consumption, raising energy costs and stressing the power supply unit (PSU) and cooling systems.</li><li><strong>Performance Bottlenecks</strong>: Consistent 100% CPU utilization can bottleneck other components like the GPU, RAM, and storage devices, leading to suboptimal performance.</li><li><strong>Noise Levels</strong>: Higher utilization and overclocking often require more aggressive cooling, increasing noise levels and potentially creating a less comfortable working environment.</li></ol><p>Translating this to humans, constant busyness leaves no time for creative thinking or effective problem-solving, leading to burnout, decreased work quality, and overall productivity loss.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="preventing-the-effects-of-high-utilization-in-humans">Preventing the Effects of High Utilization In Humans<a class="hash-link" href="#preventing-the-effects-of-high-utilization-in-humans" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Similar to a CPU, there are ways to mitigate these effects:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="be-strategic-about-100-utilization">Be Strategic About 100% Utilization<a class="hash-link" href="#be-strategic-about-100-utilization" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Strategic planning for 100% utilization during critical periods can be beneficial but should be done cautiously to avoid long-term negative effects.</p><ul><li><strong>Critical Deadlines</strong>: Reserve 100% utilization for critical deadlines or important milestones. Ensure the team understands the importance and temporary nature of this increased workload.</li><li><strong>Clear Communication</strong>: Communicate clearly about the reasons for the increased workload, its expected duration, and available support. Transparency helps manage expectations and reduce stress.</li><li><strong>Support Systems</strong>: Provide additional support during these periods, such as extra resources, temporary team members, or access to mental health services.</li></ul><p>By being strategic about 100% utilization and ensuring adequate cooling-down periods, you can maintain a healthy and productive team, ready to tackle challenges without burning out.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cooling-down">Cooling Down<a class="hash-link" href="#cooling-down" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Allow periods of reduced workload for recovery and creative thinking to maintain long-term productivity and prevent burnout.</p><ul><li><strong>Scheduled Breaks</strong>: Implement regular breaks throughout the workday. Encourage short breaks to rest and recharge, improving focus and productivity.</li><li><strong>Downtime Projects</strong>: Allocate time for side projects, learning opportunities, or innovation days. This gives a break from usual tasks and fosters creativity.</li><li><strong>Flexible Work Hours</strong>: Offer flexible work hours or remote work options to accommodate different working styles and needs, leading to a more balanced and satisfied team.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="monitoring-and-feedback">Monitoring and Feedback<a class="hash-link" href="#monitoring-and-feedback" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Just as monitoring CPU temperatures and stability is crucial, regularly checking in on your team's workload and well-being is essential. This can involve:</p><ul><li><strong>Regular Check-ins</strong>: Schedule regular meetings to discuss workload, challenges, and signs of burnout. Encourage open communication and provide a safe space for concerns.</li><li><strong>Performance Metrics</strong>: Use tools to monitor the team’s performance and workload. Metrics like cycle time, throughput, and work-in-progress (WIP) limits help understand the team’s capacity and adjust workloads accordingly.</li><li><strong>Feedback Loops</strong>: Establish continuous feedback loops for team input on processes, workload, and job satisfaction. This helps make informed decisions to improve productivity and well-being.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="preventing-bottlenecks">Preventing Bottlenecks<a class="hash-link" href="#preventing-bottlenecks" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>To prevent bottlenecks in your development process, consider these strategies:</p><ul><li><strong>Task Prioritization</strong>: Prioritize tasks by urgency and importance. Ensure critical tasks are completed first to avoid overwhelming the team with less important work.</li><li><strong>Workload Distribution</strong>: Distribute tasks evenly among team members to avoid overburdening individuals, which can lead to delays and decreased productivity.</li><li><strong>Cross-Training</strong>: Encourage cross-training to ensure multiple team members can handle different tasks, reducing dependency on single individuals and allowing for a more flexible team.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts<a class="hash-link" href="#final-thoughts" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>It's easy to fall into the trap of continuous sprinting and overutilization at work, so recognizing the importance of balance is crucial. Allowing time for cooldown periods, fostering creativity, and ensuring a healthy work environment are essential for long-term success.</p><p>Sustainable productivity is about creating an environment where teams can thrive, innovate, and deliver high-quality work consistently.

Do you find one approach more valuable than the other, and if so, why?</p><p>Drawing inspiration from the book Radical Candor, this article will discuss the categorization of engineers into Superstars and Rockstars. We'll examine their unique traits, contributions, and roles within the development process.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="superstar-engineers">Superstar Engineers<a class="hash-link" href="#superstar-engineers" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Superstar Engineers are those who strive for more than just the ordinary, who are ready to take calculated risks for innovation. Within the technology sector, they act as catalysts for change and disruption.</p><p>Some traits you can find in the work of these engineers:</p><ul><li>They continuously pursue growth and development</li><li>They’re not content with the status quo</li><li>They’re willing to take risks to innovate</li><li>They’re frequently the driving force behind breakthroughs  in technologies, processes, practices, or products</li><li>They’re motivated by a passion for innovation and growth</li><li>They propel the team forward, ensuring it stays relevant and competitive</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rockstar-engineers">Rockstar Engineers<a class="hash-link" href="#rockstar-engineers" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Rockstar Engineers are the backbone of the team, providing the dependability that keeps everything running smoothly. Without their steady influence, the boundary-pushing work of Superstars would be far less effective.</p><p>Some traits you can find in the work of these engineers:</p><ul><li>They provide stability and consistency within the team.</li><li>They're domain experts, with a deep understanding of particular systems or processes</li><li>They ensure the smooth running of systems and processes</li><li>They manage and enhance existing systems</li><li>They're highly reliable, often serving as the go-to person for issues within their domain</li><li>They're incredibly dependable, often the first person you'd call for problems in their area</li><li>They value quality and take genuine pride in their work</li><li>While they may not be the most visible, their contribution to the team and the business is absolutely critical</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="types-of-engineers-and-engineering-strategy">Types of Engineers and engineering strategy<a class="hash-link" href="#types-of-engineers-and-engineering-strategy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Having discussed different types of engineers, let's now explore how this impacts various aspects of our company or team.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team--company-composition">Team &amp; Company Composition<a class="hash-link" href="#team--company-composition" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It's crucial to strike a balance between these two types of engineers inside a team or company. The optimal engineering strategy blends Superstars and Rockstars, ensuring the team has both the stability to manage current tasks and the innovative spirit required to stay competitive.</p><p>An overabundance of Superstars may lead to instability due to frequent changes, causing the team to remain in a perpetual state of upheaval.</p><p>On the other hand, an excess of Rockstars might lead to stagnation, preventing the team from adapting to necessary changes and reducing productivity.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="remuneration--growth">Remuneration &amp; Growth<a class="hash-link" href="#remuneration--growth" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Equally important than having the correct profiles is ensuring that both are valued equally. </p><p>This is often a challenge as engineering ladders tend to favor Superstars, who are generally more motivated to climb the ladder.
These ladders often dictate an employee's financial compensation. Leading to Superstars accelerating their remuneration faster than Rockstars, who may hit a pay ceiling.
For this, it's important to tie compensation not to a specific role, but to the unique value an individual contributes to the company or team.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts<a class="hash-link" href="#closing-thoughts" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Recognizing this duality and managing it effectively is one of the key roles of leadership in the tech industry.

            <description><![CDATA[Explore the journey from forming a team to creating a high-performance tech team. Discover the stages of team development, learn about traits of high-performance teams, and uncover effective tools to enhance team dynamics for optimum productivity.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all continuously hear about high-performance teams and the importance of becoming one. But there is actual no real definition of it. Is it?</p><ul><li>A team that releases many cards</li><li>The one that delivers high-quality code</li><li>The one that has all the best engineers</li></ul><p>The answer, at least for me, is none of the above. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-a-team">What is a Team?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-a-team" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>A definition by Professor Leigh Thompson of the Kellogg School of Management: </p><blockquote><p>A team is a group of people who are interdependent with respect to<br>
<!-- -->information, resources, knowledge and skills and who seek to combine<br>
<!-- -->their efforts to achieve a common goal.</p></blockquote><p>A group itself does not represent a team, for a group to become a team, there is a need for a common goal. As a group evolves into a team, it needs to go through several transformations.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="evolution-from-group-to-team">Evolution From Group to Team<a class="hash-link" href="#evolution-from-group-to-team" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Teams typically go through several stages of development. These stages represent the journey from a group of strangers to a united group with common goals.</p><p>Tuckman's model describes the four stages of team development as:</p><ol><li><strong>Forming</strong>: This is the initial stage where team members meet for the first time. Everyone is polite and positive, and there are high expectations but little understanding of the tasks ahead.</li><li><strong>Storming</strong>: As team members start to work together, differences of opinion may lead to conflict. This stage is marked by resistance, competition, and conflict as individual personalities emerge.</li><li><strong>Norming</strong>: Gradually, the team moves into the norming stage where they start to resolve their differences, appreciate colleagues' strengths, and respect the leader's authority. The team begins to develop cohesion and unity.</li><li><strong>Performing</strong>: This is the stage where the team is fully functional and works towards achieving the team's goals. There is a strong bond between team members, and everyone works collaboratively and efficiently.</li></ol><p>On the top of Performing, we could say there is o<strong>utperforming</strong> is where <strong>High-Performance</strong> teams live. This final stage is reached when the team consistently exceeds expectations and delivers exceptional results. The team is highly collaborative, innovative, and operates with a shared vision and purpose. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transitioning-from-one-team-stage-to-another">Transitioning from One Team Stage to Another<a class="hash-link" href="#transitioning-from-one-team-stage-to-another" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ol><li><strong>Forming to Storming</strong>: The transition from forming to storming requires team members to start working together and engaging in discussions and decision-making. It's important for each member to feel comfortable expressing their opinions and ideas, even if they differ from others. This phase often triggers conflicts due to diverse views, but it is a crucial part of the team's evolution, as it allows members to understand and appreciate each other's perspectives.</li><li><strong>Storming to Norming</strong>: The shift from storming to norming is marked by the resolution of conflicts and the establishment of processes and norms. This stage requires effective conflict management and open communication. Besides, the team should focus on recognizing and appreciating the strengths of each member and fostering a collaborative environment. The team begins to feel a sense of unity, and a collaborative culture starts to develop.</li><li><strong>Norming to Performing</strong>: Moving from norming to performing entails the team becoming more focused on achieving shared goals. The team has now established effective working relationships and understood each other's working styles. At this stage, it's important to stay focused on the team's objectives and ensure everyone is working collaboratively towards them. The team becomes more autonomous, with members taking on responsibilities and roles that align with their strengths.</li><li><strong>Performing to Outperforming (High-Performance)</strong>: The leap from performing to outperforming is achieved by exceeding expectations consistently.

This turns the hiring process into a lengthy, high-effort endeavor that can span multiple months. As you can see, from application to hire, we're looking at an average of 32 days and a time investment of 15.5 hours.</p><p>In competitive markets—such as the one I'm familiar with—the top candidates are often hired within a maximum of two weeks after applying for a job. How can this be?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-issue-at-hand">The Issue at hand<a class="hash-link" href="#the-issue-at-hand" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Over-engineering can be pinpointed as the root cause of the issue.</p><p>Here are the three main concerns that lead to this:</p><ul><li><strong>Risk Avoidance Leads to Over-Complication:</strong> Trying to avoid any slip-ups during the hiring process often results in a complicated and lengthy procedure. This method is more about reducing the risk of a bad hire, even if it sacrifices speed and efficiency.</li><li><strong>Fear of Overlooking the Perfect Candidate:</strong> The worry of not finding that potentially perfect candidate leads to an exhaustive process. Every candidate is meticulously screened at each stage, lengthening the hiring period.</li><li><strong>Concern Over Wasting Employee Time:</strong> The fear of spending current employee time on unsuccessful hiring processes is a worry. This concern stems from knowing that time is valuable, especially in fast-paced work environments. If the hiring process doesn't yield a successful hire, it's considered a misuse of employee time that could have been used for immediate needs and goals.</li></ul><p>However, lengthy processes are the embodiment of these fears. The rationale is straightforward: the top candidates are often the first to be snapped up. If your hiring process is sluggish due to numerous feedback loops, chances are you're missing out on top-tier talent.</p><p>Remember, most companies aren't engaged in rocket science, which means you probably don't need a rocket scientist on your team. What you do need are team players who can collaborate effectively and add value to your product.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/df75203e-cd58-41eb-8339-d5bf4288eb0e/5bda32ba-6fad-4a72-b770-456f2f682215/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LB4666VSUFUQK%2F20250731%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20250731T115512Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEKv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIHoSO8TGUzjX%2FooDEYC77hpQ08I%2BNBmeZbb7GVD2QmqbAiEA4vyMI7gRiMr5hBqvFK8e4GTfYBjEHOs8Lc6u6sSm%2FnsqiAQI1P%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARAAGgw2Mzc0MjMxODM4MDUiDAmxF5wKk5IDcBf6MCrcA5sEGYXg8iIJecHEmb87WNumhvscmQ1lMNx%2Bmu9TZYxo6xnbVHgfwM2cXo%2FgP5JbN%2BOaOQfLiSfKzbmFx4bikdram3gEla4EC9f4MSkwdqoe28a9eZvdtK1aYUnSQ02aoItQaFJY4HUzio3cFn2ibjbp5CFGYXH3V7AKYDfrztyUm9lmjKO9BwzgFEenQ8MpoBnvJeejO8QePaXH9BYlWz7L3RMJ7ystJ%2BBD9%2Fu4VbU%2B8HBfIv5oDbMljL%2Ff%2BaJmVxuy77wrFKHvoJWgolHtJrIjftGxl5qMWkVRKuvRD5Pnn%2FxZSs6n%2B2WHdIlmOToTQkn%2FTpFLOYA9qry4fNLprheMqCaoy6Vtdj%2FndgrOcqmQ5YnFNwn95j4LI3noiRLAPaDeiyCRxHzBuhGZehTblGvVdrl5cz2gxLUtZh%2BdiZlHYbs%2Baa1DkXKvNnCfg6AqHxATC7iOtG3JiCnqWP%2F8bRfZPCp4%2FhCxVqh%2BM2qf8oqU0n2rKlY3NqoyQLoXpGh%2FSvOzj3trBbPG9w0n7JJJ9fRg5XFUL4L86dVdcurFL2Q3scW%2F6dneBjLnP%2FZFK3YrqKaWUyLrkZKNZnRzizyJY0WkOrUhrhUqOJP7QDkqfvKbIIlP5DT1zptwN5%2BRMMedrcQGOqUBAFOjsqY59XWkGhGfGiDGEz4mzF5M9mr04h1nJUSfO7%2FMcgE1sgg0mTpjitg8V8xZGvfp1TWyNl6DT1Rsyi04hVr5ll3rE1K6iHmWuY6jTaU2IMnF814LTKGoTB25d6j9SocTxcjJuynJCLIPtRh1SD8PHzNB1KZX7R843IbMqo7dvtp9qKuvZe3OsNxKYYOgObXCB3IXcFs%2Bbf9l%2B%2Bv3faXKmwMk&amp;X-Amz-Signature=c81a4d4f156ae3c3c3785c683ca969b3bbe6d6573a436778a2dc6a6d7293362a&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&amp;x-id=GetObject" alt="https://devrant.com/rants/2848905/interview-vs-job" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="solving-the-problem">Solving the problem<a class="hash-link" href="#solving-the-problem" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>To attract and secure top-tier talent in a fast and efficient manner, it is imperative to streamline and reform our hiring process.</p><p>The objective is to create a process that is not only efficient in its operations, but also effective in securing the best possible talent for our teams. This approach must consider the existing challenges in the hiring process and devise solutions that counter these issues, while optimizing for speed and quality of hires.</p><p>To facilitate such transformation in the hiring process, we need to undertake the following steps:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="simplify-evaluation-process">Simplify Evaluation Process<a class="hash-link" href="#simplify-evaluation-process" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The prevailing approach in many companies operates like a wishlist, confirming that candidates meet an extensive set of expectations. However, these wishlists often become an endless array of checkboxes that candidates must tick off.</p><p>A more efficient solution would be to invert this evaluation method, implementing a flagging system to identify what is unacceptable in a candidate. This method streamlines the process, as it's a true or false evaluation where we all have the same expectation. Instead of having a checklist of 100 items that can have different readings by the evaluator to be covered in 2 to 4 technically focused interviews, we're able to identify any red flags in just one or two interviews.</p><p>Let's see examples that I have seen in real life:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Wishlist</th><th>Flags</th></tr></thead></table><p>| <strong>Coding Interview:</strong></p><div

The idea is that like a determined tortoise, we can reach our goals by moving deliberately in the right direction. But could there be a more efficient approach?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-comfort-zone-a-default-state">The Comfort Zone a Default State<a class="hash-link" href="#the-comfort-zone-a-default-state" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>It's widely recognized that individuals typically operate within their comfort zones. But what exactly is the comfort zone? Here's a potential definition:</p><blockquote><p>The comfort zone refers to a psychological state in which one feels familiar, safe, and at ease. It is the area of experience where a person operates in an anxiety-neutral condition, using a limited set of behaviors to deliver a steady level of performance, usually without any sense of risk or need for change.</p></blockquote><p>Sticking to what's familiar can often deter us from making significant strides in improving our lives. More often than not, we choose minor, incremental changes that don't veer too far from our routine.</p><p>This fondness for comfort zones isn't just personal—it extends into software development practices and product development too. Frequently, teams would rather make minor adjustments than take the risk of adopting an entirely new approach. This could be due to fear of failure, resistance to change, or simply not being aware of the potential benefits of a different approach.</p><p>Sure, these incremental changes are easier to manage and implement. They cause less disruption to our current systems and processes, letting us maintain stability and make small steps forward. But, they can also restrict our potential for innovation and growth. When we only focus on baby steps, we might overlook the chance to make a big leap that could bring about significant benefits.</p><p>This leads us to ask: Are these small improvements enough? Do they truly meet the needs of the team and the organization, or are they simply a safe and comfortable route that leads to average results?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="signs-of-need-for-change">Signs of Need For change<a class="hash-link" href="#signs-of-need-for-change" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Let's consider some signs that may indicate the presence of comfort zones:</p><ul><li><strong>Stalled Progress</strong>: If we see little to no significant progress over a lengthy period, it could mean our team might be tweaking things without making a real impact. In this case, the next level of improvement could be further than anticipated.</li><li><strong>Reluctance towards new ideas</strong>: A quick dismissal or resistance to new suggestions can indicate a deep-rooted reluctance to change. This resistance is often due to the comfort of the familiar, fear of the unknown, and potential risks associated with change.</li><li><strong>Unchanging strategies</strong>: If we find ourselves continually resorting to the same solutions or minor variations of past strategies, it suggests that we're stuck in a comfort zone. A hesitation to try new approaches, especially when facing repetitive challenges, signals a comfort zone.</li></ul><p>Therefore, it's crucial to continually assess your team's adaptability. If there are signs of stagnation, resistance to change, or a lack of creative problem-solving, it may be time to challenge the comfort zone and think about making more substantial changes instead of small, incremental ones.</p><p>If you are already measuring the behavior, you will notice comfort zones can be represented as logarithmic functions. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/df75203e-cd58-41eb-8339-d5bf4288eb0e/26a9ed95-154a-4067-93be-3e546a6b040e/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LB466S55LPARM%2F20250731%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20250731T115508Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEKv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIEcjj5Ijjqi7jbc6pLtn3oiQ%2Fl83%2Be8bFhwTlEuUhOTPAiEA45ipQt%2Ft5%2BGEJO9HILzhyjBhGrSR98G%2FSYfdLEkAo60qiAQI1P%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARAAGgw2Mzc0MjMxODM4MDUiDMQBHS2Lz5AgjU%2BCwyrcA2uSKjuUtdW7kmd88nHnT0dMG1Uzn4LFLqD1MaL603yEtjWkIA3CjM%2Fe7hCd%2BLM%2BEhDK69QAwPMYffs%2FatfCNCZgoXfxVsH5vkgSk7sTX3iL71RAS%2By8N3IBlUTAYR114pLFOEXBh0KkDbZwVIKxBkOzexzCpThuJ70LtymrEc4QRCGfPJxhzOzlKQ44QBFYZiuqgKdMMYNsto%2Ff03xdo9ymyMUmEm1i2gx9uvAhdu51%2BUTj23%2FabOe93jDRDI9zqh1Bl2xYDuqfybNBngM26DtxsGcpikLCSHUUi77%2FadEeFPLgcBl1erdn54xtz4cLHfKyg1Hff%2BtZsbLDkWGUfaHrxQS0FR7AavmIYtEBj52%2B24xOkuUVGXQEbdFrDX8X6o6A0YMVlX9WmU7rHhKTtTX5g3FgcNcAhrDtGBKqtche%2BZVbMv0DyWddMSN0FTE9Z2yAB%2FXGLCC3oTr379Jqt1NjPFqOrvMrAiTd2sIYXnI8TDJGIxd2kSkjfmxBRRGRvC1i8mY9%2Fd8n95%2BwdfyhDZq0i1satPf0Tv%2Bfh5LrsXfEGY7gzVS6SmDyP17tR9JJWvJSZ3nfSJOAk7XhWn6k%2BDspOTUpj75bFgpoL7J9zyKnRlgH61TZvPW25GxpMOmdrcQGOqUBMYZV%2FqDeYbl8iuDsCmEIPEMQOX16Un3ZxgdfZZUecYRc5XJynfhnj9UdFR2m21Vbwkm4b%2FQoklnyikH48L4BN%2BNbOjIWk6Js8B4HIND%2B3K8i0kzX0%2BU93WDPXELEEf46HbhPCs23N8pZYXk4rvm3jX8slXmjzLMKtiZTDaem1iPhIMQHZTifmddZc4xW%2FfWUTZj6mlHL%2BMvNID%2BDlNdL3li4Ote0&amp;X-Amz-Signature=7ffc1b11fdab2107837efedef68e422fd9eec425099dbf3443459e29894f92e7&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&amp;x-id=GetObject" alt="Untitled.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="implementing-change">Implementing Change<a class="hash-link" href="#implementing-change" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Recognizing the need for change is just the beginning. Here's how we can pave the way forward:</p><ol><li><strong>Spot key metrics</strong>: Initiate by spotting key metrics that accurately represent the area you're aiming to enhance. These metrics should be specific, measurable, and directly tied to the performance or behavior you're looking to improve.</li><li><strong>Gauge the current situation</strong>: Use these as a benchmark to contrast your future performance and evaluate the progress of your initiative.</li><li><strong>Set a North Star</strong>: Set a clear, ambitious yet attainable goal that will steer your efforts. This goal should push your team to step out of their comfort zone, but still be within reach. Ensure this goal is in line with your wider business objectives and resonates with your team members, providing them a strong incentive to aim for the initiative.</li><li><strong>Estimate the gap</strong>: Evaluate the difference between your current performance and your North Star. This is the distance your team needs to traverse to achieve the desired improvement. Understanding this gap will give you a clear sense of the scope of the change required and will help shape your strategy for the initiative.</li><li><strong>Plan the change</strong>: Having defined your key metrics and North Star, begin plotting the course required for the initiative. You will be faced with 2 options:<ol><li><strong>Bold Move</strong>: Occasionally, a significant departure from the current state to your ultimate goal is necessary. Always consider this as your primary option.</li><li><strong>Gradual Progress</strong>: If the change appears overwhelming or too abrupt, reduce it by taking smaller steps towards your ultimate goal.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Review and Refine</strong>: Continually track your progress and compare it to your initial benchmark. Use this information to fine-tune your approach, adjust your strategy, and implement necessary modifications.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts<a class="hash-link" href="#final-thoughts" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>It's crucial to remember that change is not always easy, but it's often necessary for growth. Incremental improvements have their place, but occasionally, we need to take confident leaps to truly innovate and realize our full potential. By willing to step outside our comfort zones, we open ourselves up to new possibilities and opportunities for improvement. Next time you're with your team, ponder over these topics. It's vital to identify your guiding star to reach it.
For example, consider this in the context of your team's productivity. What practices could make you the most efficient team? For me, the answer was Extreme Programming (XP). You might contemplate a significant shift from individual development with pull requests to mob programming, and smaller steps towards adopting Trunk-Based Development due to the need for additional tools.</p><p>Also, don't hesitate to think creatively about product development. For instance, we often have to shift Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to meet Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), like increasing the lead conversion percentage. If the leap percentage is high, you might need to implement revolutionary new strategies, rather than sticking with the status quo.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the end, we need to ask ourselves the question if we are either “problem solvers” or “executing monkeys”.</p><p>The role of engineering professionals is evolving, moving from a sole focus on knowledge to an all-encompassing approach, represented by the “T-shaped” model. The objective is not just to build right, but to build what's necessary. This calls for a blend of product, technical, and interpersonal skills.
For leaders, this translates into promoting continuous learning, cross-functional teamwork, and advocating for stepping beyond comfort zones, thereby cultivating a culture that appreciates all facets of everyday work.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="t-shape-a-blend-of-breadth-and-depth">T-Shape: A Blend of Breadth and Depth<a class="hash-link" href="#t-shape-a-blend-of-breadth-and-depth" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The T-shaped model is the idea that everyone should possess a depth of vertical expertise in their preferred area (the vertical bar of the “T”) while also having a broad horizontal understanding of ancillary areas (the horizontal bar of the “T”).
This dual focus ensures not only the capability to execute specific tasks but also the ability to see beyond and understand the larger context, ensuring that what is built is truly what is needed and also not selling snake oil.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="vertical-expertise-the-depth">Vertical Expertise: The Depth<a class="hash-link" href="#vertical-expertise-the-depth" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The vertical bar of the “T” serves as a symbol for an individual's core skill set, demonstrating their domain of deep expertise. It is their specialty, the area where they could be considered an expert or a specialist.
This deep expertise is what most people have traditionally concentrated on in their day-to-day professional lives. It's the strength that they bring to the table in their field and what they are known for.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="horizontal-skills-the-breadth">Horizontal Skills: The Breadth<a class="hash-link" href="#horizontal-skills-the-breadth" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The horizontal bar symbolizes the broad range of complementary skills outside of one's core expertise. This notably includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Product Sense</strong>: An understanding of the product's goals, target users, and market position. This involves empathy towards the user's needs, an appreciation of user experience (UX) principles, and the ability to prioritize features based on user and business value.</li><li><strong>Collaboration and Communication</strong>: The ability to work effectively with cross-functional teams, including product managers, designers, and other stakeholders. Clear communication of technical difficulties, solutions, and trade-offs in a way that is accessible to non-technical team members is vital.</li><li><strong>Business Acumen</strong>: A grasp of the business context in which the product operates. This includes understanding the competitive landscape, business models, and how one's work contributes to the overall success and strategy of the company.</li><li><strong>Adaptability and Learning</strong>: The capacity to quickly learn new skills, adapt to new tools, technologies, and methodologies as required by the ever-changing tech landscape.</li><li><strong>Any &amp; All Technical Knowledge</strong>: refers to a wide range of technical skills and understanding that one might need to do their job effectively. It emphasizes the need for individuals to be comfortable with various technologies and able to learn and adapt to new technical tools and methodologies as required.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="benefits-of-becoming-t-shaped">Benefits of becoming T-Shaped<a class="hash-link" href="#benefits-of-becoming-t-shaped" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Here are the benefits of becoming T-shaped:</p><ul><li><strong>Personal Growth</strong>: The T-shaped model encourages continuous learning and adaptation, leading to personal and professional development.</li><li><strong>Enhanced Job Satisfaction</strong>: Having a broader understanding of the product and the business can make the work more meaningful and satisfying.</li><li><strong>Increased Marketability</strong>: With a diverse set of skills, T-shaped people are more attractive to employers in a competitive job market.</li><li><strong>Job Security</strong>: The ability to adapt to new technologies and methodologies also provides more job security in a rapidly changing industry.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rounding-up">Rounding Up<a class="hash-link" href="#rounding-up" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As you may have noticed, I am not naming development anywhere.

By fostering these all-rounded professionals, engineering leaders can ensure their teams are not just executing to spec but actively contributing to the creation of meaningful, impactful products. As we progress into increasingly complex and user-centric markets, the T-shaped approach will undoubtedly become not just beneficial, but essential for success.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="related-articles">Related Articles<a class="hash-link" href="#related-articles" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://leadshorizons.com/p/the-future-of-teams-crossfunctional-and-t-shaped" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bookmark</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

From my early days in on-site environments, savoring technical discussions around me, to remote work across different regions, embracing the nomadic lifestyle and thriving in multicultural settings.</p><p>Let's delve into this topic further in the article.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="work-location-in-the-past-5-years">Work Location in the past 5 Years<a class="hash-link" href="#work-location-in-the-past-5-years" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Let's address an important aspect first. Remote work isn't a novel concept that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, I've been working remotely from various locations including France, Spain, and the USA since 2016. The tools and infrastructure for remote work, however, have definitely evolved over time.</p><p>Before the pandemic, the majority of companies preferred on-site operations and invested heavily in office spaces to meet their employees' needs.</p><p>However, the pandemic essentially forced a large-scale social experiment in remote work. The majority of us had to adapt to working from home. Surprisingly, it turned out to be quite effective!</p><p>However, as the pandemic winds down, there's an increasing push from companies to revert to the pre-pandemic model. Interestingly, many employees are reluctant to give up the benefits of work-life balance they've experienced during this period (less commute, more family time, more personal time, etc).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-different-modalities-of-work">The different modalities of Work<a class="hash-link" href="#the-different-modalities-of-work" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Before we delve further into the topic, let's look at the different work models.</p><ul><li><strong>On-Site</strong>: This is the conventional work model where employees need to be physically present at a particular location, often an office, to do their work.
This means the employee needs to be in the same city as the company at all times.</li><li><strong>Hybrid</strong>: This flexible model blends on-site and remote work. Employees might work from home some days and be in the office on others.
This usually means the employee needs to be in the same city as the company.

This doesn't require the employee to be in the same city as the company.
Some subtypes include:<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">- **Quarterly days**: A certain quota needs to be met within a specific timeframe that enables the person to work remotely.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">- **On-demand travel**: There are instances where travel is needed for significant interactions that require groups of people to collaborate.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">- **Full remote**: unless it's necessary, the employee doesn't need to travel at any particular time.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div></li></ul><p>As we can see, there are subtle differences that separate a Hybrid from a Remote work model. The deciding factor that differentiates one from the other is the employee's ability to be located in the same city or nearby.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="excuses-to-go-back-to-the-office">Excuses to go back to the office<a class="hash-link" href="#excuses-to-go-back-to-the-office" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Some of the reasons that can be affecting the current situation:</p><ul><li><strong>Distrust of Employees</strong>: Some companies might harbor concerns about the potential lack of productivity when employees work remotely. These concerns stem from the belief that without direct supervision, employees might be more prone to distractions or unproductive behaviors. Working from home introduces a complexity to the monitoring of employees that some companies dislike.</li><li><strong>Cultural Concerns</strong>: A strong, cohesive company culture is often considered a key factor in a business's success. Some companies believe that this culture can only be fostered through face-to-face interactions and shared experiences that come with working in the same physical space. They worry that remote work might dilute this culture, making it harder to maintain shared values, facilitate team bonding, and encourage a sense of belonging among employees.</li><li><strong>Performance Changes</strong>: The shift to remote work can bring about changes in employees' performance. This is a complex matter as employee performance does not have a single definition, and as we will see later in this article, it can be driven not only by the person but by their environment.</li><li><strong>Office Investments</strong>: Companies that have invested substantial amounts of money in their office spaces may feel compelled to make use of these investments. These investments could include not just the physical office space itself, but also equipment, furniture, and other amenities designed to make the office a comfortable, productive environment. The continued payment for office rents, maintenance, and utilities while the space remains largely unused can also be a motivating factor to return to the office.</li><li><strong>Investor Contributions</strong>: In an investment landscape, investors often diversify their investments as a risk management strategy. A significant portion of these investments may be allocated to real estate, directly or indirectly, through various investment funds. If the workforce shifts towards remote work, the demand for these office spaces could decrease, leading to potential implications on the return on investment for these real estate investments. Therefore, the trend towards remote work can have a broader impact on the investment community.</li><li><strong>Community Impact</strong>: The presence of office districts in cities and towns has resulted in the creation of numerous jobs in various sectors. The local economy in these districts frequently thrives on the regular influx of office-goers. This includes a wide range of businesses such as restaurants, cafés, fitness centers, and retail stores, all of which rely substantially on the footfall generated by employees working in nearby offices. These businesses can be significantly influenced if more people transition to remote work. As the footfall decreases, these businesses may struggle to sustain themselves, leading to potential job losses and broader socio-economic implications.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="debunking-concerns">Debunking Concerns<a class="hash-link" href="#debunking-concerns" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="distrust-of-employees--performance-changes"><strong>Distrust of Employees &amp; Performance Changes</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#distrust-of-employees--performance-changes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>While personal skepticism can influence views, performance assessments should be driven by solid data. With that in mind, let's delve into some of the available data:</p><blockquote><p>One ground-breaking Stanford study on the subject, which included 16,000 participants, found a marked increase in remote employee output—even for employees who only worked from home a few days a week. During the study, the telecommuting group displayed a 13% average improvement in performance over the office-based control.</p></blockquote><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[Source](https://qz.com/1627980/remote-work-can-boost-productivity-if-you-have-the-right-tools)</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>While we possess this data, it's important to note that our employees' performance can fluctuate between different work modalities.</p><p>In both Remote and On-site work environments, everyone operates under the same modality, thus establishing a unified workflow. Conversely, the Hybrid mode can introduce complications. This is due to certain sub-categories that we've discussed, where some individuals are local and others are remote. Such a dynamic can inadvertently impact the performance of remote workers, not through any fault of their own, but due to potential exclusion or differential treatment.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cultural-concerns"><strong>Cultural Concerns</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#cultural-concerns" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The cultural concern is normally embodied by the phrase:</p><blockquote><p>There are things that happen in the office, that don't happen in remote</p></blockquote><p>The concept here is that specific discussions occur naturally in a local setting. Hybrid work capitalizes on this by emphasizing the value of office days when such interactions can take place. However, a common concern among hybrid employees is that they spend a substantial portion of their office time on remote calls.</p><p>Conversely, effective communication and the right tools are crucial for remote work to ensure these interactions can be replicated. This is an area many companies are still struggling to address effectively.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="office-investments"><strong>Office Investments</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#office-investments" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Investments, particularly in real estate, are often expected to grow over time; hence they can be complex. It's essential to distinguish companies between two groups based on their ownership of the space:</p><ul><li><strong>Owners</strong>: As outright owners of the physical space, this asset is a key component of their balance sheet. Naturally, they'll want to maximize its value, as it directly impacts their valuation.</li><li><strong>Renters</strong>: With temporary ownership, the space represents an ongoing cost that they need to manage. Minimizing this cost can significantly enhance their profit margins.</li></ul><p>As you might expect, each group has a distinct focus. On-Site will likely appeal to Owners, while Remote will be more beneficial for Renters.</p><p>As you can see and </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="addressing-remote-concerns-make-remote-work">Addressing Remote Concerns: Make Remote Work<a class="hash-link" href="#addressing-remote-concerns-make-remote-work" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>From our observations, the primary concern stems from the absence of a unified approach and a shared workspace.</p><p>As a company, to surmount these challenges, we can adhere to a few key principles:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="remote-first">Remote First<a class="hash-link" href="#remote-first" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The guiding principle of this work model is:</p><blockquote><p>If one person is remote, everyone is remote</p></blockquote><p>This approach aims to treat all employees equally, irrespective of their location. Every process, ranging from meetings to casual conversations, should be designed keeping remote employees in mind. This method ensures that remote workers are not sidelined or disadvantaged compared to their on-site peers.</p><p>To this end, investing in the right collaborative tools is crucial so that everyone has the same access and capabilities. Here are some tools you might need:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Virtual White Boards</strong>: Most meetings involve some form of interaction that typically takes place on whiteboards in an office setting. If we use a physical whiteboard in conjunction with a conferencing tool, we risk limiting the involvement of remote participants. Therefore, having a virtual alternative is necessary. A good example of this is <a href="http://miro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miro</a>, where you can invite people to collaborate live on various types of boards</p></li><li><p><strong>Pairing Software</strong>: To work efficiently in pair or mob programming, we should simplify collaboration as if everyone were working on the same machine. Code with me from IntelliJ is an example of this.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq0fCMCK-Yw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq0fCMCK-Yw</a></p></li><li><p>Collaborative Knowledge Base: It's important to have a centralized location for team and company information. However, many tools are rigid and lack concurrent editing capabilities. We need to ensure we choose the right tool for our needs. Personally, I've found <a href="http://notion.so/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notion</a> quite useful.</p></li><li><p>Collaborative Documents: Just like our knowledge base, we need the ability to concurrently edit documents like presentations and spreadsheets when preparing for presentations or budget cycles. Google and Microsoft offer robust products with the necessary features.</p></li><li><p>Async Communication Tools: All workers need their focus time, so having the right tools for asynchronous communication, including a chat application and traditional email, is essential.</p></li></ul><p>The last three tools are not exclusively for remote work but are important for any work mode.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="virtual-office">Virtual office<a class="hash-link" href="#virtual-office" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Much like a physical office promotes interaction and collaboration, a virtual office offers an online shared space for employees to engage, collaborate, and foster relationships.</p><p>This isn't merely about conferencing tools, but about the creation of social environments with virtual desks and communal areas. These tools enable employees to engage in organic conversations when close to another's virtual desk, relax in virtual coffee spaces, indulge in games, and more. Gather.town is a prime example of such a tool.</p><p>It's also worth noting the cost-effectiveness of virtual offices compared to traditional physical spaces.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbllvQZRyh0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="parting-words">Parting words<a class="hash-link" href="#parting-words" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Remote work has the potential to be as effective as in-office work, offering employees better work-life balance without compromising the company culture that we hold dear. Like many challenges in our industry, successful remote work hinges on using the right tools. The traditional tools used for in-person work may not be suitable for this new dynamic.</p><p>To be candid, hybrid work models often fall short in numerous ways, often representing a compromise rather than an ideal solution. In my view, hybrid models are the most challenging to manage and their impacts are not always evident.</p><p>Given this, it's essential that we reassess the paths our companies are taking. We may be inadvertently hindering our own potential due to a few manageable concerns.</p><p>[1][https://wfhresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WFHResearch_updates_April2024.pdf]<!-- -->(<a href="https://wfhresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WFHResearch_updates_April2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wfhresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WFHResearch_updates_April2024.pdf</a>)</p><p>[2][https://qz.com/1627980/remote-work-can-boost-productivity-if-you-have-the-right-tools]<!-- -->(<a href="https://qz.com/1627980/remote-work-can-boost-productivity-if-you-have-the-right-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://qz.com/1627980/remote-work-can-boost-productivity-if-you-have-the-right-tools</a>)</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I currently feel like the odd one, out. It appears that many people are associating peer review in software with code reviews via pull requests. Do you also share this perspective?</p><p>Even before I transitioned into leadership roles, where coding took on a secondary function, I did not engage in pull requests. In fact, I haven't submitted a pull request in a professional context since 2017.</p><p>Let's delve into the nuances of the peer review process in this article.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="understanding-peer-review">Understanding Peer Review<a class="hash-link" href="#understanding-peer-review" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Peer reviews, also commonly referred to as peer assessments, involve a rigorous and structured process whereby a professional's work or research is evaluated and critiqued by one or more individuals who possess similar competencies, educational background, and expertise. This concept and methodology of peer review originated and took root in the academic sphere, where it is routinely employed as a critical tool to appraise and judge the value of scholarly outputs and research findings.</p><p>The primary function of this system is to serve as a form of quality control, significantly bolstering the credibility, reliability, and overall accuracy of the work that is being reviewed. This is achieved by providing an additional level of scrutiny, thereby eliminating any potential errors or oversight that might have been missed by the original author.</p><p>Fundamentally, peer review is a cooperative and collaborative process. It is meticulously designed to enhance the quality of work produced, encourage continuous learning and improvement among professionals, and support the establishment and maintenance of objectivity. It ensures that the work produced adheres to the highest standards of excellence, providing an essential layer of accountability in professional settings.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="software-development-peer-reviews">Software Development Peer Reviews<a class="hash-link" href="#software-development-peer-reviews" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Within software development, peer reviews often manifest as code reviews. This involves a developer scrutinizing a software project's source code to identify bugs, errors, or potential enhancements. It's about more than just pinpointing issues—it's also about understanding varied methodologies and learning from colleagues.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="types-of-code-review">Types of Code Review<a class="hash-link" href="#types-of-code-review" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I want to emphasize this point, as it appears that the contemporary software development scene may not fully grasp it.</p><blockquote><p>Code reviews aren't always synonymous with Pull Requests 🤯</p></blockquote><p>Let's delve into the alternatives:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/df75203e-cd58-41eb-8339-d5bf4288eb0e/503307b1-972e-4006-8987-2f81eaa0849f/peer_review.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LB466TXTDZXAE%2F20250731%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20250731T115508Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEKv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIQDp7cQ3wh7CTeoCCgaoakm0%2BhutFa3xok02MwxiVB2ADAIgEVBFUQpBstVJFCUS2HEv7o%2BPtvUw1bDG%2BAkG0n2wStgqiAQI1P%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARAAGgw2Mzc0MjMxODM4MDUiDIEr9zsbzIwAimHHXircAz42ZPYHWz86V97UIspB8uhhR1pOpVWSkrDVCwxVbkSOXMPUsepo5rLr%2FsR5Aou1Dsa8N7fmwDWkh0eloIIQzLlIMRnhdV%2FZTML6WIemaEmf42BL92%2BGWqLtYYz301TfaA664JyLO%2BS0y2wVfTKkwCaoiHhwnxgrUMchQ1FCSuWHBAeXkt13rHzHfjG9%2B2fvtGss2UrroK9cZIGdepts%2F6qSUgPXWUowqMnIdtg0DGFX8a4LxVyUipgqQJlqo0UcjhdhbpGdEIIVKh8nQPQSNmk3VAY2Zd4XXUTbUgSYJhfNSRMNj%2Bjv18Q7tGRK1qMeHq%2FOKd%2Fh3Dl2Xh86E4OX7FjWFF8hcBvAQzPDHXJp4Vq3HIO7KMMJcKD%2Fpv8ckDH0BaYwFFj%2FBKEZITSlog4YQ6IkwGlFk0Rh1E5Rd4cqgeMMpuo%2FzcU1UeJKaBnpFJVon9vAVGAazGNXcer%2FFoVSjcna7DVK2AA14u0VfFMAHWfxdF78hDkBcNb10PfKi4ZYasrILM4xwo4UFUxDCBR12kGXsDUoYpJxXRZ40ltOyBPbaSSiG0Ke27UfRlbnhlGLvH%2B0E0zZDQvQBzCxMvgwRwfi7JfwuExoG1l2pRC37Hrqh0VOKvcB%2BRXQvBi7MJ2drcQGOqUBmvzUHUWlrG44EOLodvRDaHYdeVCeJdeQDqT2vfR%2BPUWV0s8YwRQgO1vBJAcQhXR2j16YnqC5w9j0lMj3Xe5k5QpsqUSyzRQmtHlJ8uzdpDzK0uPHmOO3cs2bMzZtsOjkoHuA464y%2Fa0ZA8zKuOUd8cBA4TRZ3dWMcC0jADb1KfIkQDChRDmZ1BEw2lWt6NMtyl3tcOUIiBrQH7GUjOo16DcEWt7Z&amp;X-Amz-Signature=8f3964a377a76fdc00fe1774b123f152fd2f37c57e2884be98f0355543a2c313&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&amp;x-id=GetObject" alt="peer_review.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Kent Beck has offered a two-dimensional perspective on the types of peer reviews in his <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/thinking-about-code-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a>. The two dimensions are:</p><ul><li>Synchronicity: Refers to the timing of the review process. It can occur in real-time as the code is being written (synchronous) or after the author has completed the code (asynchronous).</li><li>Continuity: Considers the workflow in relation to the review process. It can either allow the author to continue working (non-Blocking), or require the author to pause until the review is completed (Blocking).</li></ul><p>Let's explore what does each of this peer review means:</p><ul><li>Formal Review: A formal review is a thorough and systematic evaluation of a project, product, or performance. It is often conducted by a group of qualified individuals and follows a specific procedure or set of criteria.</li><li>Pull Request: A Pull Request is a feature in version control systems, like Git, where a developer proposes changes to a codebase. The request is a way to communicate the changes to the team and ask for review and integration into the main code branch.</li><li>Over The Shoulder Review: This is an informal method of code review where one developer looks over the author's shoulder as the latter walks through the code.</li><li>Code Comments:  In this approach, developers annotate the source code with comments. These comments offer insights, point out potential issues, and suggest improvements.</li><li>Pair Programming: This is a method where two programmers work simultaneously at one workstation. The “driver” writes the code, while the “observer” reviews each line of code as it's being written.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-relation-between-feedback-cycle--waste">The Relation Between Feedback Cycle &amp; Waste<a class="hash-link" href="#the-relation-between-feedback-cycle--waste" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Inherent to the process of peer reviewing is its role as a “quality” gate. As such, many these processes tend to fall into the blocking quadrant of operational procedures. This characteristic of peer reviews can create situations where individuals become idle, waiting for the process to be unblocked. This idle time is not only detrimental to productivity, but can also affect morale and engagement among team members if they span over time. Therefore, it is important to streamline the feedback cycle to minimize these idle periods and maintain efficient workflow dynamics.</p><p>In addition, the involvement of a second individual to review the work is also necessary for any type of peer review process. Implying that the longer the feedback cycle between the generation of code and its review, leads to an increase in waste and rework. This is due to the fact that the longer the delay in feedback, the greater the potential for the initial work to diverge from the optimal path, necessitating more significant changes and revisions later on.</p><p>Therefore, it is crucial to establish a swift and efficient feedback cycle in peer review processes. By doing so, we not only reduce the likelihood of waste and rework, but also enhance the overall productivity and effectiveness of our teams.</p><p>If we take this into account, we want to be as much as possible in the sync &amp; non-blocking quadrant, as the synchronicity causes a small feedback cycle and the non-blocking minimizes the IDLEs. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/df75203e-cd58-41eb-8339-d5bf4288eb0e/1293ddd5-7e74-4e39-a041-3bc532d3d432/peer_review2.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LB466TXTDZXAE%2F20250731%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20250731T115508Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEKv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIQDp7cQ3wh7CTeoCCgaoakm0%2BhutFa3xok02MwxiVB2ADAIgEVBFUQpBstVJFCUS2HEv7o%2BPtvUw1bDG%2BAkG0n2wStgqiAQI1P%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARAAGgw2Mzc0MjMxODM4MDUiDIEr9zsbzIwAimHHXircAz42ZPYHWz86V97UIspB8uhhR1pOpVWSkrDVCwxVbkSOXMPUsepo5rLr%2FsR5Aou1Dsa8N7fmwDWkh0eloIIQzLlIMRnhdV%2FZTML6WIemaEmf42BL92%2BGWqLtYYz301TfaA664JyLO%2BS0y2wVfTKkwCaoiHhwnxgrUMchQ1FCSuWHBAeXkt13rHzHfjG9%2B2fvtGss2UrroK9cZIGdepts%2F6qSUgPXWUowqMnIdtg0DGFX8a4LxVyUipgqQJlqo0UcjhdhbpGdEIIVKh8nQPQSNmk3VAY2Zd4XXUTbUgSYJhfNSRMNj%2Bjv18Q7tGRK1qMeHq%2FOKd%2Fh3Dl2Xh86E4OX7FjWFF8hcBvAQzPDHXJp4Vq3HIO7KMMJcKD%2Fpv8ckDH0BaYwFFj%2FBKEZITSlog4YQ6IkwGlFk0Rh1E5Rd4cqgeMMpuo%2FzcU1UeJKaBnpFJVon9vAVGAazGNXcer%2FFoVSjcna7DVK2AA14u0VfFMAHWfxdF78hDkBcNb10PfKi4ZYasrILM4xwo4UFUxDCBR12kGXsDUoYpJxXRZ40ltOyBPbaSSiG0Ke27UfRlbnhlGLvH%2B0E0zZDQvQBzCxMvgwRwfi7JfwuExoG1l2pRC37Hrqh0VOKvcB%2BRXQvBi7MJ2drcQGOqUBmvzUHUWlrG44EOLodvRDaHYdeVCeJdeQDqT2vfR%2BPUWV0s8YwRQgO1vBJAcQhXR2j16YnqC5w9j0lMj3Xe5k5QpsqUSyzRQmtHlJ8uzdpDzK0uPHmOO3cs2bMzZtsOjkoHuA464y%2Fa0ZA8zKuOUd8cBA4TRZ3dWMcC0jADb1KfIkQDChRDmZ1BEw2lWt6NMtyl3tcOUIiBrQH7GUjOo16DcEWt7Z&amp;X-Amz-Signature=bb983e8fca5de0b8adb136b32a09a754c6dba6a3039c8f108f8f3b494552c08d&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&amp;x-id=GetObject" alt="peer_review2.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="debunking-pair-programming-myths">Debunking Pair Programming Myths<a class="hash-link" href="#debunking-pair-programming-myths" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>Why're then we not all doing pair programming?</p></blockquote><p>Pair programming is often misunderstood and associated with numerous fallacies, specially in the realm of efficiency of project resources and velocity.

<!-- -->• the designs are better and code length shorter (ongoing brainstorming and pair relaying);<br>
<!-- -->• the team solves problems faster (pair relaying);<br>
<!-- -->• the people learn significantly more, about the system and about software development (line- of-sight learning);<br>

            <description><![CDATA[Boost your workplace productivity and job satisfaction by understanding and effectively managing second level relationships. Learn about their impact, methods to assess them, and strategies to enhance these relationships.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Workplaces operate as complex social ecosystems, with dynamics that reach beyond our immediate coworkers and supervisors to include a broader network of relationships. These secondary connections, which are frequently underestimated, are vital to personal success and the overall effectiveness of an organization.</p><p>Have you ever thought about how to manage these second level relationships? This post aims to delve into the concept of second level relations at work and their significance.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="understanding-second-level-relationships">Understanding Second Level Relationships<a class="hash-link" href="#understanding-second-level-relationships" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Second level relations in a work context refers to connections with individuals or groups outside your immediate team, who nonetheless can dramatically impact your work. This includes stakeholders, teams from other departments, service providers, and clients. Much like distant relatives in a family, you may not interact with them daily, but their influence on the work environment can be significant.</p><p>These second level relations have a substantial impact on productivity. For example, a good rapport with a key stakeholder could mean faster approvals and quicker project completion. Similarly, positive relations with other teams can foster cross-departmental collaboration, creating a more cohesive and efficient work environment. Conversely, negative relationships could cause problems. That's why it's essential to proactively manage these relationships.</p><p>Now, let's categorize and delve into these relationships.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stakeholders"><strong>Stakeholders</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#stakeholders" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p> A stakeholder can be an individual, group, or organization that has an interest in, or can be affected by, the outcomes of a project or business activity. This can include other employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders who have a stake in the project or organization's success.
Stakeholders can significantly influence the direction and success of our projects, as they are the promoters of the needs that we are trying to solve. Maintaining open communication, understanding their needs and expectations, and addressing their concerns proactively can foster a positive and productive relationship. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="other-teams"><strong>Other Teams</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#other-teams" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>These are groups within the same organization but working on different projects or tasks. They may have different goals and objectives, but their actions and decisions can significantly influence the progress of our projects. </p><p>Healthy relationships with other teams can facilitate better resource sharing, problem-solving, and collaboration. Miscommunication or disputes with other teams can hinder progress, cause delays and create a challenging work environment. Thus, it's essential to maintain clear communication and mutual respect with other teams.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="providers"><strong>Providers</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#providers" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>These are the external organizations or individuals who supply goods, services, or expertise that are essential to our projects. This can include everything from software vendors, consulting firms, to freelance experts. Providers can have a significant impact on our project timelines, budgets, and overall success. </p><p>If a provider fails to deliver as expected, it can cause delays, increase costs, or even jeopardize the entire project. On the flip side, a reliable provider who understands our needs and reliably meets their commitments can be a key factor in a project's success. Therefore, maintaining good relationships with providers is crucial. This involves clear communication, timely payments, and treating them as partners in our success.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="clientscustomers"><strong>Clients/Customers</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#clientscustomers" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>These are the end-users of the product or service we are developing. They can greatly influence our projects, as their feedback and satisfaction often determine the project's direction and success. </p><p>Understanding their needs, addressing their concerns quickly, and valuing their feedback are essential for a positive relationship. A satisfied client can lead to repeat business, positive word-of-mouth, and improved reputation, while an unsatisfied client can hinder the project's success.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="determining-importance-of-relationships">Determining Importance of relationships<a class="hash-link" href="#determining-importance-of-relationships" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In assessing the value of relationships, it's key to look at aspects like how often you interact, how interconnected your work is, and their sway in decision-making. By ranking relationships with these factors in mind, you can direct your energies where they'll have the most impact - after all, we can't cultivate every relationship equally.</p><p>I typically use Stakeholder Mapping to gauge influence and examine the state of a relationship.

It's important to frequently reassess the status and influence of your second-level relationships and modify your strategies as needed.</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="improving-relationships">Improving Relationships<a class="hash-link" href="#improving-relationships" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>When relationships that require enhancement have been pinpointed, a variety of specific strategies can be implemented to foster growth and improvement in these areas:</p><ul><li><strong>Empathize</strong>: It is crucial to not only understand but also empathize with the concerns, anxieties, and reservations that the other party may have. This involves putting yourself in their shoes and viewing situations from their perspective, which can go a long way in building mutual understanding and respect.</li><li><strong>Be proactive</strong>: Rather than waiting for the other party to take action or initiate improvements, it's beneficial to take the first step. This proactive approach shows your commitment to the relationship and can inspire the other party to reciprocate your efforts.</li><li><strong>Improve Communication</strong>: Quite often, the root cause of relationship issues is miscommunication or a complete lack of communication. It's essential to understand the communication needs of the other party and act upon them. This could involve being more open, transparent, or timely with your communication, or perhaps adjusting your communication style to better match theirs.</li><li><strong>Build the connections</strong>: Beyond the professional capacity, take the time to get to know the person behind the role. Keep in mind that not all factors that motivate a person are work-related. By sharing personal experiences and being open to finding common ground and understanding, you may discover shared interests or values that can strengthen your working relationship. Better interpersonal relationships can contribute to a more cohesive and productive working environment.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In conclusion, second level relations at work, though not immediately visible, have a substantial impact on an individual's work experience and the overall productivity of an organization. Effective management of these relationships can lead to improved collaboration, smoother workflow, and enhanced job satisfaction. As the work environments continue to evolve, recognizing and nurturing these secondary relationships will become an increasingly important aspect of workplace strategy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past year, the buzz word in technology has undeniably been "AI". But what exactly do we mean when we say AI?</p><p>Often, our comprehension of terms and definitions can be clouded due to the ambiguity in the language used. A prime example is the term "Artificial Intelligence" (AI). This term used to encompass a broad spectrum of technologies, but recently, it has become largely associated with Large Language Models (LLMs).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-we-talking-about">What are we talking about?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-we-talking-about" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>AI, in its purest form, is the ability of a machine or computer program to think and learn. It is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. </p><p>Meanwhile, LLMs are defined in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia article</a> as: </p><blockquote><p>A language model notable for its ability to achieve general-purpose language generation and other natural language processing tasks such as classification. LLMs acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from text documents during a computationally intensive self-supervised and semi-supervised training process.<!-- -->[1]<!-- --> LLMs can be used for text generation, a form of generative AI, by taking an input text and repeatedly predicting the next token or word</p></blockquote><p>It goes without saying that we have yet to reach the real definition of AI, with neither LLMs nor other technologies.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-psychology-of-llms-hype">The Psychology of LLMs Hype<a class="hash-link" href="#the-psychology-of-llms-hype" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>What has made these large language models so intriguing over the past year, prompting such widespread interest?</p><p>Their ability to “bullshiting with confidence”. Just try this out yourself, ask any question to an LLM and just tell them they are mistaken and request another option. You'll typically receive an apology followed by an assertive, alternative response.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/df75203e-cd58-41eb-8339-d5bf4288eb0e/702b745b-8e9a-437c-a8ee-92063ef1b0c2/llm1.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LB4662ZSZUZAG%2F20250227%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20250227T120441Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEDsaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIGU6LXH8i2FLPa9OFjiGjh93AKScJq9NkZds%2B9G2RvD5AiBq1iLukn2fcNuIDfJBHBgLfgWv4iTp9X2A5VpBlglZ1ir%2FAwh0EAAaDDYzNzQyMzE4MzgwNSIMF78PHZWG3zuMoNKpKtwDQItA96I6PJbmNv8SglAUABpdP8%2FZgSM%2F3rjRj%2FqEdTQXodJyV57sxuFX4Zd7eQTipVtF8xStGHHcUO7yygDO4sW3ejlfVnFUdVyuVMOTkKoknBimwTnyqicvlkOZW5JwEpfpN%2F0vBOrQyK%2BcoiapetQEhj%2B5KzH2JiuCkd3bSvIFOGfpninJXFCIO5qLnEGU54u4RB%2FNKNSXhHaF4cywdI8zrUKiw1ePUC0DU2uJoOWD3mHlwN175rZd7lZjtIYwVd8gIn8ctjy7%2BdtgJ2dojH3CGZIZdmBIB55BY4N5tTHOytSH00cFakN3o70UhrCCncQPwKufhdsfm2F7xmxjs9IPdjyTw9wRvGTaVqcvjf44HEXSCtEwenrWgQEgFLYgssGK2d92WKNccfP1mC96xO8fRlaqKHOy5XOIw2LBuU%2FWx4JlZHiKexaX8LxwaF4%2FDKOtaPWSavRGk79vylaftHGn60uxqQoGYbtgnzu2u9W9IEH151Zva%2FDgrDFDy39XlRgVVS2QNLzmD%2BoqmPhyd1xqGLELCBRtEid0PNStUQwGRYW4rgFjffUUqTknyZ2u7MFocFIutKiSti8lwlcqxKTWW1lq4ss98F9rXzhuLnydhh1STmu6Vy%2FKCrUw75CBvgY6pgFyIo5wwML0tu%2BZ0SH9%2FqfeTwivSkFMzPhU8aXACgiEsXGeVK%2FgTUoOna%2F5t%2Fj8VHSo%2BLjZ%2Fi0QK86iPPK%2F0%2FX0LSptPinmBSFOT2Xy1JKvjo6Ae3azdHl7GrJxLaf7gg7xdI3eUtidBEBWFTWHV1UhF6vzqKhqPA3fXEv%2Bqhv45d799Ekh%2FeAIeo38mQQ9dKXpBqVJ1i9FrzYw24PtmTJYEDQSvmzV&amp;X-Amz-Signature=a65a4a322f8ebcc81a58b8d8719feb7ff0a1d43c4794f8ff63a8a43e3c1bfcde&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;x-id=GetObject" alt="llm1.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>To clarify, these software models aren't intentionally deceptive. They simply aim to provide responses that align with your queries. Meanwhile, we as recipients are prone to accept information as accurate, especially when it's delivered with apparent confidence. This applies to both machine-generated responses and human communication. Even this paragraph, written by a non-psychologist, likely seems plausible because it's framed convincingly.</p><p>So how does an LLM “bullshiting with confidence”. LLMs are trained to recognize patterns in data and make predictions based on these patterns. Essentially, they are statistical functions that predict, given the words in a question, the words that will form a compelling response. This phenomenon of non-accurate but compelling responses goes by the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hallucinations</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="llms-at-the-workplace">LLMs at the Workplace<a class="hash-link" href="#llms-at-the-workplace" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Are LLMs useless? Not at all. Despite the caution required due to the nature of statistically generated responses, these systems can indeed provide substantial value.</p><p>Let's explore potential applications:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="user-facing-products">User-Facing Products<a class="hash-link" href="#user-facing-products" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Interestingly, this technology might just be the first to convince humans they're interacting with another human or an intelligent entity. This opens up new product opportunities where the perceived "human interface" might have more value than the precise accuracy of the content.</p><p>Potential applications could include:</p><ul><li>First-tier customer support: By integrating LLMs with user manuals, we could develop a chatbot interface for customers.</li><li>Sales representatives: LLMs could be utilized to create more human-like, machine-driven robot calls or chatbots.</li></ul><p>Does this mean human roles will be totally replaced? No, because LLMs lack a true understanding of the problem or the conversation. Therefore, a second level of human intervention remains essential. However, this technology could help businesses scale their operations in a novel way.</p><blockquote><p>⚠️ Personally, I would not use the current technology for products that require accuracy. (example: tax calculations, finances, etc.).</p></blockquote><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="company-tools">Company Tools<a class="hash-link" href="#company-tools" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Typically, businesses possess an extensive amount of data that encapsulates their knowledge base. Filtering this data can be challenging, especially when it's scattered across various systems, making it tough to query. Leveraging LLMs can significantly streamline this process and reduce the mental strain of pinpointing the required information.</p><blockquote><p>⚠️ Keep in mind, LLMs do normally not provide precise responses. Thus, it's crucial to critically assess the answers and cross-reference with the original data for accuracy.</p></blockquote><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="work-augmentation">Work Augmentation<a class="hash-link" href="#work-augmentation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>This tool has a wide range of applications that can be incorporated into daily workflows. Let's explore some common utilization.</p><p><strong>Writing Assistance</strong></p><p>LLMs can provide valuable support in crafting documents, emails, and other written communications. They offer grammatically correct and contextually fitting sentence suggestions, enhancing the overall writing process.</p><p>As a general rule, this is a highly productive use of the technology. Just ensure to review the generated suggestions for maximum benefit.</p><p><strong>Reference Tool</strong></p><p>LLMs can serve as a dynamic reference resource, drawing on the vast expanse of knowledge they've been trained on. They function like a sophisticated search engine, delivering consolidated information.</p><blockquote><p>⚠️ However, as LLMs may not always provide accurate responses, it's crucial to approach the information critically and cross-check with original data sources when necessary.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Coding</strong></p><p>Within the realm of coding, LLMs can help in code generation and even in writing documentation. This is possibly the field that can affect most of the readers of this newsletter, so let's do a deep dive on this point.</p><p>From my professional experience, we've opted not to utilize this technology so far. The main factors influencing this decision include:</p><ul><li>Quality Inheritance: The quality of code that LLMs generate is directly linked to the quality of the training data. If the model is trained on data that includes poor or flawed code, the generated code will inherit those flaws.</li><li>Cognitive Load: While LLMs can simplify routine coding processes, they can also increase the cognitive burden on developers who need to review and comprehend the generated code, ensuring it meets expectations. Developers may face a choice of accepting the code as-is with potential issues or spend additional time deciphering the proposed code.</li><li>Licensing: Employing LLMs may lead to potential breaches of software licenses. If the model is trained on code under copyleft licenses (e.g., GPL), the generated code could be seen as derivative, thus resulting in licensing complications.</li></ul><p>Additionally, upon reviewing the data accumulated over the duration this technology has been in existence, we can observe the following results:</p><ul><li>Supporting Data:<ul><li>Microsoft Experiment: The results were that developers using copilot were able to complete the task 55.8% faster.</li><li>Pinterest  Experiment (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70Rc4wJRluA&amp;t=1032s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Link</a>):  They found that their engineers who commit code less often increased their commit rate by 50-100%, and engineers who commit code the most often became about ~40% more productive.</li></ul></li><li>Detracting Data:<ul><li>Git Clear Research (<a href="https://www.gitclear.com/coding_on_copilot_data_shows_ais_downward_pressure_on_code_quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Link</a>): analyzed approximately 153 million changed lines of code, they found code churn (the percentage of lines that are reverted or updated less than two weeks after being authored) is projected to double in 2024 compared to its 2021, pre-AI baseline.</li><li>Security Researchers (<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/25/github_copilot_study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Link</a>): Explored Copilot's performance on three distinct code generation axes (examining how it performs given diversity of weaknesses, diversity of prompts, and diversity of domains). In total, we produce 89 different scenarios for Copilot to complete, producing 1,689 programs. Of these, we found approximately 40% to be vulnerable.</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>⚠️ While the technology shows promise, it's not fully developed yet.<br>

I strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with potential threats and reading more about this topic via the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/assets/PDF/OWASP-Top-10-for-LLMs-2023-slides-v1_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OWASP TOP 10 for LLMs</a> resource.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The term "Artificial Intelligence" (AI) has recently become synonymous with Large Language Models (LLMs). However, true AI, the ability of a machine to think and learn, has not been achieved with LLMs or other technologies. </p><p>LLMs have gained popularity due to their ability to generate convincing responses, but these responses are merely statistical predictions based on input data. Despite this, LLMs can be valuable in the workplace, serving as user-facing products, company tools, and work augmentation. However, caution is advised due to their lack of accuracy. </p><p>Lastly, it's imperative that we bear in mind our social responsibility as creators and innovators in the realm of technology. With the current global population standing at 8.1 billion, each decision we make, each technological advancement we introduce, has the potential to impact a vast number of lives. We should, therefore, strive to prioritize the wellbeing of each individual in this global community, ensuring that our contributions to technology are both ethical and beneficial to all.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How much time do you or your team spend on the day to day vs. planing the future? .</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff644c4da-a1f5-47af-8dda-0341bd3af204_1080x1080.png" alt="https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff644c4da-a1f5-47af-8dda-0341bd3af204_1080x1080.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I would tend to think that for most this is not a binary situation, as we need to be able to have a plan and deliver on it. For this, we require practicing and intentionally using different types of mindsets. Let’s delve into this deeper in this article.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="balancing-today--tomorrow">Balancing Today &amp; Tomorrow<a class="hash-link" href="#balancing-today--tomorrow" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Working in engineering demands a careful balance between two distinct mindsets: the strategic and the tactical. Understanding these two mindsets and knowing when to apply each is crucial for successful leadership and team performance. Let's delve into what each of these mindsets entails.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="strategic-mindset">Strategic Mindset<a class="hash-link" href="#strategic-mindset" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>Where do we need to go?</p></blockquote><p>A strategic mindset is forward-looking. It's about setting goals, identifying opportunities, and developing plans to achieve those goals. It involves thinking about the bigger picture and the future direction of the team or the organization, providing a common path for everyone.</p><p>An example of a strategic mindset could be considering organizing the company in vertical slices, to define common tools and practices, etc.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tactical-mindset">Tactical Mindset<a class="hash-link" href="#tactical-mindset" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>What do we need to do?</p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, a tactical mindset is about the here and now. This involves focusing on the tasks at hand, solving problems as they arise, and executing the immediate steps of any strategy. This mindset is required to survive.</p><p>An example of a tactical mindset could be keeping legacy money-making systems running healthy, fixing a bug that affects clients, etc.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="problems-of-being-stuck-in-one-mindset">Problems of Being Stuck in One Mindset<a class="hash-link" href="#problems-of-being-stuck-in-one-mindset" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Balancing the strategic and tactical mindsets is not an easy task. It requires conscious effort, adaptability, and situational awareness. To lead effectively, engineering leaders must be able to switch seamlessly between these two mindsets, adapting to the fluctuating needs of their team and the project at hand.</p><p>If any of the mindsets is dominant, it can lead to issues on a company and team level. Let's discuss the problems of being stuck in each of these mindsets:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tactical">Tactical<a class="hash-link" href="#tactical" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Being overly tactical can lead to:</p><ul><li><strong>Lack of bigger picture</strong>: Without a strategic approach, leaders might become so focused on immediate issues that they lose sight of broader goals and objectives</li><li><strong>Lost opportunities</strong>: A purely tactical approach might miss out on potential opportunities for improvement or innovation, as the focus is solely on dealing with the immediate issues at hand.</li><li><strong>Increased Baseline</strong>: Quick fixes might be preferred over sustainable solutions, leading to extra effort of maintenance and the need for extra hands to maintain systems up and running.</li><li><strong>Crisis management loop</strong>: A purely tactical mindset can lead to a reactive approach where leaders are constantly dealing with immediate issues rather than planning for the future, keeping the team in a perpetual state of crisis management.</li><li><strong>Burnout</strong>: The continuous pressure to handle immediate issues and the lack of preventive measures can lead to increased stress and eventual burnout.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="strategic">Strategic<a class="hash-link" href="#strategic" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Being overly strategic can lead to:</p><ul><li><strong>Analysis Paralysis</strong>: Spending too much time planning and strategizing can lead to indecisiveness, delaying important decisions and actions.</li><li><strong>Missed details</strong>: Overemphasis on the big picture might lead to overlooking important details, which can result in faulty execution of strategies.</li><li><strong>Disconnect from the team</strong>: Leaders who are overly strategic might lose touch with the day-to-day challenges their team faces, leading to unrealistic plans and expectations.</li><li><strong>Frustration among team members</strong>: If leaders are always focused on future plans, team members might feel their immediate concerns are being ignored, leading to dissatisfaction and frustration.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-role-progression-from-tactical-to-strategic">The Role Progression: From Tactical to Strategic<a class="hash-link" href="#the-role-progression-from-tactical-to-strategic" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As engineers progress in their careers and take on more senior roles, there’s often a necessary shift from a primarily tactical mindset to a more strategic one.</p><ul><li><strong>Early Career (99% Tactical, 1% Strategic):</strong> Focuses primarily on tactical tasks such as coding, debugging, and learning new technologies. Their work is closely guided by the guidelines set by the bigger picture.</li><li><strong>Mid-Career Engineer (90% Tactical, 10% Strategic):</strong> Start to introduce tactical work with strategic thinking to prepare themselves for future work. They are knowledgeable about larger parts of the codebase and product, allowing them to provide input for strategical decisions.</li><li><strong>Late Career Engineer (60% Tactical, 40% Strategic):</strong> Continues to execute hands on work, but spends an increasing amount of time on strategic tasks. They make architectural decisions, mentor other engineers, align with other teams engineers.</li><li><strong>Leaders (30% Tactical, 70% Strategic):</strong> Spends a significant amount of their time on strategic tasks. They are responsible for planning and coordinating the team's work and ensuring that it aligns with the company's strategic goals.</li><li><strong>Directors (5% Tactical, 95% Strategic):</strong> Primarily focused on strategic tasks. They make decisions about the overall direction of the engineering team, manage resources, and coordinate with other parts of the business.</li><li><strong>C-Level (1% Tactical, 99% Strategic):</strong> Almost entirely focused on strategic tasks. They set the technological direction of the company, make decisions about the use of resources, and represent the engineering team at the executive level.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A strategic mindset focuses on setting goals and planning for the future, while a tactical mindset concentrates on immediate tasks and problem-solving. However, overemphasis on either mindset can lead to issues such as lack of broader vision or missed details. As engineers progress in their careers, there is often a shift from a primarily tactical mindset to a more strategic one, with leaders and executives focusing more on strategic tasks.</p><p>I hope this post has helped solve the long-standing question of what is this person doing in their role. And helps also to understand how successful engineering requires a balance between strategic and tactical mindsets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Their insights help prioritize features based on business value and customer impact.</li><li><strong>Data Analyst</strong>: Plays a crucial role in informing decision-making through data. They collect, process, and analyze data related to product performance, customer behavior, and market trends. By turning data into actionable insights, data analysts help the team understand user needs, measure product success, and identify areas for improvement.</li></ul><p>Incorporating these roles into a product team ensures a comprehensive approach to product development, where strategic vision, technical execution, user experience, quality assurance, operational stability, business alignment, and data-driven decision-making converge to create products that truly meet customer needs and drive business value.</p><p>These roles not always need to be different people, nevertheless they are skill that team members need to have or nurture. We could talk here about the T-shapped engineering concept but i am sure you can find deeper knowledge in  newsletter and other resources I have published on the past.  </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="understanding-vertical-slicing"><strong>Understanding Vertical Slicing</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#understanding-vertical-slicing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Vertical slicing refers to the process of breaking down functionalities and features into smaller, manageable pieces that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. This method contrasts with the traditional horizontal slicing, where projects are divided among different departments or layers (e.g., backend, frontend, database). Implementing vertical slicing necessitates a cultural shift and strategic planning:</p><ol><li><strong>Redefine Team Composition</strong>: Transition from discipline-centric teams (e.g., a backend development team) to cross-functional teams that include members capable of handling all aspects of feature development, from UI design to database management.</li><li><strong>Adopt Customer-Centric Approaches</strong>: Align team objectives and features development with customer journeys and value delivery. Each slice should represent a step towards solving a customer problem or fulfilling a need.</li><li><strong>Foster a Collaborative Mindset</strong>: Encourage open communication and collaboration within and among product teams. This can be facilitated by regular stand-ups, shared goals, and common platforms for project management and documentation.</li><li><strong>Leverage Agile and DevOps Practices</strong>: Implement agile methodologies and DevOps practices to support the rapid development, testing, and deployment of vertical slices. Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are essential for automating these processes.</li><li><strong>Train and Mentor</strong>: Equip your teams with the necessary skills and knowledge to function effectively in this new environment. This might involve cross-training to ensure that team members can handle multiple aspects of development and operations or specific training in agile methodologies.</li><li><strong>Measure and Adapt</strong>: Establish metrics to measure the effectiveness of product teams and the impact of vertical slicing on product development. Use these insights to continuously improve processes and adapt strategies as needed.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="slicing-your-organization-into-product-teams">Slicing your organization into product teams<a class="hash-link" href="#slicing-your-organization-into-product-teams" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Most companies will not be organized in this ways so its important to understand how to get there if its our objective. Initiating the transition towards product teams and vertical slicing involves several key steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Define the user journey:</strong> Understand the path your user takes when interacting with your product or service. This includes the initial contact, engagement, and long-term interaction. Understanding the user journey helps to identify gaps and opportunities in your product or service.</li><li><strong>Event storming of the value journey:</strong> This is a collaborative workflow of brainstorming and problem-solving using sticky notes to visualize the sequence of events in a user journey. This method helps to identify actions and interactions the user experiences.</li><li><strong>Map to existing products:</strong> Align the event storming with your existing products. This can provide insights into how well your products fit into the user journey and where improvements or new products might be needed.</li><li><strong>Reorganize ownerships:</strong> This involves adjusting team responsibilities to align with the user journey and product mapping. Teams should own certain steps of the user journey to ensure they are focused on delivering value at each stage.</li><li><strong>Re-architecture if necessary:</strong> If your current system architecture does not support the user journey and product mapping, consider a redesign. This could involve breaking down a monolithic system into microservices or adjusting your tech stack to better serve user needs.</li><li><strong>Support teams on mentality change:</strong> Transitioning to a user journey-focused approach with vertical slicing and product teams requires a shift in mindset. Support your teams through this change by providing training, fostering open communication, and promoting a culture of collaboration.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>By embracing the concept of product teams and implementing vertical slicing within software departments, leaders can create environments that are more agile, innovative, and aligned with customer needs. This approach not only enhances the efficiency and quality of product development but also fosters a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement. As an engineering leader, steering your organization towards this paradigm will necessitate thoughtful planning, commitment, and adaptability, but the resulting advantages can profoundly transform your product development lifecycle.</p>]]></content:encoded>

They ensure code readability, maintainability, and scalability. But blindly applying these practices, without considering the project's specific context, can lead to inefficiencies and waste.</p><p>For example, being too rigid with certain practices might slow down development in the early stages of a startup, where the ability to pivot quickly is key.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-real-world-example">A Real-World Example<a class="hash-link" href="#a-real-world-example" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>Please take this as an example and not literal agains this specific pattern. I share as its what is fresh in my mind as I've experienced this in at least two workplaces over the last year.</p></blockquote><p>We're currently seeing a lot of hype around Clean Architecture, which involves using the Ports &amp; Adapter Pattern. Well-known figures like Uncle Bob or Vaughn Vernon advocate for it, making it the center of attention.</p><p>In many organizations, every single project starts as a Ports &amp; Adapters project, focusing on business logic and separating it from external contact points. While the pattern can be valuable at a code level, we need to consider its drawbacks:</p><ul><li><strong>Starting up:</strong> Setting up a Ports &amp; Adapters project takes more initial time, potentially delaying the first release. It may not be the best fit for projects with tight deadlines or a priority on launching a minimum viable product quickly.</li><li><strong>Cognitive load:</strong> Ports &amp; Adapters can increase the cognitive load for developers, especially those unfamiliar with the pattern. It might require more training and time for developers to understand and use effectively, slowing down development.</li><li><strong>Over-engineering:</strong> The Ports &amp; Adapters pattern can lead to over-engineering, especially in simple projects where such a complex structure isn't needed. This could make the code more complicated and difficult to manage.</li><li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> The Ports &amp; Adapters pattern could add more maintenance work. If a project's scope isn't too complex, a simpler architecture might be easier to maintain and evolve over time.</li></ul><p>If you have unlimited time or budget, this might not be a concern. But that's not the reality for most new products. Especially in a fast-paced product development environment where you're trying to find product-market fit or experiment with user reactions, this could hinder your profitability.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F946c07cd-6ea9-4a42-b00a-9a99954c8fdc_1080x1080.png" alt="https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F946c07cd-6ea9-4a42-b00a-9a99954c8fdc_1080x1080.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="aligning-practices-with-goals">Aligning Practices with Goals<a class="hash-link" href="#aligning-practices-with-goals" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Here are some things to consider to align coding practices with your project and company goals:</p><ol><li><strong>Assess the Project Lifecycle Phase:</strong> The needs of a nascent project are vastly different from those of a mature one. Early on, the focus might be on prototyping and rapid iteration. As the project matures, stability and scalability become more important.<ol><li><strong>Proof of Concept</strong>: At this stage, you might prioritize speed over structure. The main goal is to validate your idea's feasibility, so it will be acceptable to take shortcuts in code quality and/or testing.</li><li><strong>Minimum Valuable Product</strong>: At this stage, the goal is to create a functional product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development. Therefore, while it's important to strive for reusable code, speed and functionality might take precedence.</li><li><strong>Minimum Lovable Product</strong>: This stage focuses on improving the user experience, making the product more appealing and enjoyable. While maintaining the focus on functionality, you might prioritize refining the user interface, improving performance, or adding features that enhance user satisfaction.</li><li><strong>Production Quality Product</strong>: At this stage, the focus is on refining the product into a fully-fledged offering that can sustain long-term growth. You might prioritize code quality, extensive testing, and scalable architecture, as the product's stability and performance become increasingly critical.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Understand the Business Impact:</strong> Consider how the project directly impacts the business. Projects that are critical to revenue or customer experience might require more stringent practices, whereas internal tools might allow for more flexibility.<ol><li><strong>Team Tools</strong>: For tools used by the engineering team, the balance might lean towards speed and functionality. These tools are often used to automate tasks or improve workflows, so they need to work efficiently. Code quality and maintainability can be slightly relaxed, as long as the tool's functionality and performance are not compromised.</li><li><strong>Internal Tools:</strong> These might include tools for other non-engineering departments. In these cases, the investment normally is not high so there is a need to balance functionality and code quality, maintainability, and scalability.</li><li><strong>Client Product:</strong> For products that directly touch the client, such as a mobile app or a web platform, the focus might lean heavily towards both functionality and user experience. It is crucial to ensure code quality, maintainability, and scalability to provide a smooth and reliable user experience.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Assess Team Abilities:</strong> Your team's experience and skills are essential. Consider the potential learning curve when introducing new practices, patterns, or frameworks, as they may not yield the expected results.</li><li><strong>Balance Risk and Reward:</strong> Understand the risk profile of different decisions. For example, skipping peer review process might speed up deployment but increase the risk of bugs in production.</li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="moving-forward">Moving Forward<a class="hash-link" href="#moving-forward" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As leaders, we need to ensure that our teams aren't following practices just for compliance, but are actively contributing to our company’s objectives. We should foster an environment where questioning the status quo is welcomed, as long as it's with the intent of finding better, more aligned ways to work.</p><p>This doesn't mean lowering our standards, but rather adapting them intelligently to better serve our ultimate goals. It's about efficient and effective application, not complete abandonment or blind adherence. Balancing the discipline of coding standards with the flexibility needed to meet business objectives is an art that can greatly influence the success of software projects.</p><p>Let’s create a culture that values critical thinking and adaptability as much as coding excellence. By doing so, we not only align our coding practices with our project and company goals but also empower our teams to contribute their best work towards collective success.</p><p>Thank you for reading Leads Horizons.

We will explore the different levels where Conway's law impacts and how to mitigate its effects if desired.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conways-law--alternatives">Conway's Law &amp; Alternatives<a class="hash-link" href="#conways-law--alternatives" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-status-quo-conways-law">The Status Quo (Conway's Law)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-status-quo-conways-law" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Conway's Law, proposed by Melvin Conway in <strong>1967</strong>, has withstood the test of time. It asserts that a system's design will mirror the structure of the organization that designed it. In other words, if a company has independent teams, the final product will likely consist of distinct components that function independently. Understanding this law can help organizations predict their system architecture based on their internal structure.</p><p>If we let Conway's law take the lead, regardless of our system design knowledge, the outcome may not meet our expectations, as we'll see in various layers where Conway's law can influence.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-other-side-inverse-conway-maneuver">The Other Side (Inverse Conway Maneuver)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-other-side-inverse-conway-maneuver" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The Inverse Conway Maneuver is a method of restructuring an organization to align better with the desired system architecture, which involves intentionally restructuring the organization to match the desired system architecture. This process can be challenging and disruptive, but it can lead to a more efficient and effective organization.</p><p>Key steps to successfully implementing the Inverse Conway Maneuver include:</p><ol><li><strong>Define the desired system architecture.</strong>&nbsp;This should align with the organization's goals and objectives.</li><li><strong>Analyze the current organizational structure.</strong>&nbsp;Identify where the current structure does not align with the desired system architecture.</li><li><strong>Develop a restructuring plan.</strong>&nbsp;This plan should include a timeline and a communication strategy.</li><li><strong>Implement the plan.</strong>&nbsp;This should be done in phases to minimize disruption.</li><li><strong>Monitor the results.</strong>&nbsp;Track the restructuring progress and make adjustments as needed.</li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="middle-ground-user-centric-conway-maneuver">Middle Ground (User-Centric Conway Maneuver)<a class="hash-link" href="#middle-ground-user-centric-conway-maneuver" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Conventionally, profitable software is based on user needs. Many organizations claim to be user-centric but fail to organize around them. User-centric Conway Maneuver involves focusing on our client's process and needs, which will impact the organizational structure and systems architecture.</p><p>Key steps to successfully implementing the User-Centric Conway Maneuver include:</p><ol><li><strong>Understand your Target User.</strong>&nbsp;This should align with the organization's goals and objectives.</li><li><strong>Analyze the current organizational structure.</strong>&nbsp;Identify where the current structure does not align with the desired system architecture.</li><li><strong>Analyze the current architecture.</strong>&nbsp;Identify where the current structure does not align with the desired system architecture.</li><li><strong>Develop a restructuring plan.</strong>&nbsp;This plan should include a timeline and a communication strategy.</li><li><strong>Implement the plan.</strong>&nbsp;This should be done in phases to minimize disruption.</li><li><strong>Monitor the results.</strong>&nbsp;Track the restructuring progress and make adjustments as needed.</li></ol><blockquote><p>⚠️ Note that any transformation is complex and challenging and should only be undertaken with careful planning and execution.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="layers-of-influence">Layers of Influence<a class="hash-link" href="#layers-of-influence" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Conway's Law is not just about high-level architecture; it influences various facets of system design and team collaboration. Here, we detail the layers where Conway's law manifests:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="global-architecture">Global Architecture<a class="hash-link" href="#global-architecture" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>At the Global Architecture level, Conway's Law suggests that the technical and non-technical organization definitions can affect your high-level architecture. Let's look at some examples:</p><ul><li><strong>Non-technical departments:</strong> In a company with separate marketing and operations departments, the marketing department is likely the primary stakeholder for systems related to the customer funnel, while the operations department is likely the primary stakeholder for systems related to customer care. If there is no communication between departments, your company might make promises it can't keep, or provide a poor customer experience.</li><li><strong>Technical departments:</strong> In a company with technical organizational departments where horizontals exist, your teams will reflect that structure. If not careful, you might implement very similar functionalities or overwhelm other teams with too many requirements.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="product-architecture">Product Architecture<a class="hash-link" href="#product-architecture" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In the context of a User-Centric Conway Maneuver, the product architecture level requires you to focus on how the various teams collaborate to deliver a product that fulfills user needs. You need to assess how the teams are structured and how their communication patterns align with the user journey you have defined.</p><p>For instance, if you have separate teams for front-end and back-end development, you may need to foster better communication and collaboration between these teams to ensure that your product provides a seamless user experience. This could involve regular cross-team meetings, joint planning sessions, or even restructuring teams to be cross-functional.</p><p>Your architecture may have to evolve to support this more integrated approach. For example, you may decide to use a full-stack development approach where each team is responsible for both front-end and back-end development for a certain part of the user journey. This can lead to a product architecture that is more aligned with the user's needs and can adapt more quickly to changes in those needs.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="code-architecture">Code Architecture<a class="hash-link" href="#code-architecture" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>At the code level, the User-Centric Conway Maneuver involves considering how the communication and collaboration styles of individual team members can influence the design of system components. This is where the understanding of your target user and their journey can guide the design of individual features or components.</p><p>If a developer tends to work in isolation on a feature, this could result in a component that does not integrate well with the rest of the system or does not meet user needs effectively. To address this, you may need to encourage more collaboration and communication within your team.</p><p>For instance, you could use pair programming or code reviews to ensure that all team members have input into feature development. This can lead to code architecture that is more cohesive and adaptable, and that better reflects the needs of the user.</p><p>Remember, these are just examples, and your actual actions will depend on the specific needs and structure of your organization.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="user-centric-conway-maneuver-action-plan">User-Centric Conway Maneuver Action Plan<a class="hash-link" href="#user-centric-conway-maneuver-action-plan" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>You should now be aware that Conway's law can impact your organization unconsciously. Based on our multi-layered view, let's focus on the user-centric Conway maneuver:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="global-architecture-1">Global Architecture<a class="hash-link" href="#global-architecture-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In this layer, you need to know what your business value is for your users to align to it, as it will likely change the least after you achieve a product-market fit. This knowledge can fuel your organizational and architectural changes. The knowledge required is not technical, but you should at least have defined your target user and their journey.</p><p>After defining these models, we will understand the business better, and we can map some new knowledge to reorganize and re-architect. Some possible actions from the examples we saw in the previous section:</p><ul><li><strong>Reorganize Non-technical departments:</strong> If there is no communication between marketing and operations, they need to work closer. This could involve having weekly syncs or a common leadership/organization, so their objectives are aligned.</li><li><strong>Technical departments:</strong> In the case of horizontal slicing, moving to a more user-centric environment could reorganize teams to be multifunctional and value stream aligned.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="product-architecture-1">Product Architecture<a class="hash-link" href="#product-architecture-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In the context of a User-Centric Conway Maneuver, the product architecture level requires a focus on how the various teams collaborate to deliver a product that fulfills user needs. This could involve regular cross-team meetings, joint planning sessions, or even restructuring teams to be more cross-functional.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="code-architecture-1">Code Architecture<a class="hash-link" href="#code-architecture-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>At the code level, the User-Centric Conway Maneuver involves considering how the communication and collaboration styles of individual team members can influence the design of system components. This is where understanding of your target user and their journey can guide the design of individual features or components.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In conclusion, Conway's Law provides valuable insight into how an organization's structure can impact the design of its systems. While the experience and skill of your hires certainly contribute to the quality of work, the architecture of the systems you develop will be significantly influenced by your organizational communication patterns. Hence, you will have to apply the maneuver or none depending on if you accept, mitigate, or want to pivot on the tradeoffs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It asserts that a system's design will mirror the structure of the organization that designed it. In other words, if a company has independent teams, the final product will likely consist of distinct components that function independently. Understanding this law can help organizations predict their system architecture based on their internal structure.</p><p>If we let Conway's law take the lead, regardless of our system design knowledge, the outcome may not meet our expectations, as we'll see in various layers where Conway's law can influence.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-other-side-inverse-conway-maneuver">The Other Side (Inverse Conway Maneuver)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-other-side-inverse-conway-maneuver" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The Inverse Conway Maneuver is a method of restructuring an organization to align better with the desired system architecture, which involves intentionally restructuring the organization to match the desired system architecture.

Here, we detail the layers where Conway's law manifests:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="global-architecture">Global Architecture<a class="hash-link" href="#global-architecture" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>At the Global Architecture level, Conway's Law suggests that the technical and non-technical organization definitions can affect your high-level architecture. Let's look at some examples:</p><ul><li><strong>Non-technical departments:</strong> In a company with separate marketing and operations departments, the marketing department is likely the primary stakeholder for systems related to the customer funnel, while the operations department is likely the primary stakeholder for systems related to customer care. If there is no communication between departments, your company might make promises it can't keep, or provide a poor customer experience.</li><li><strong>Technical departments:</strong> In a company with technical organizational departments where horizontals exist, your teams will reflect that structure. If not careful, you might implement very similar functionalities or overwhelm other teams with too many requirements.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="product-architecture">Product Architecture<a class="hash-link" href="#product-architecture" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In the context of a User-Centric Conway Maneuver, the product architecture level requires you to focus on how the various teams collaborate to deliver a product that fulfills user needs. You need to assess how the teams are structured and how their communication patterns align with the user journey you have defined.</p><p>For instance, if you have separate teams for front-end and back-end development, you may need to foster better communication and collaboration between these teams to ensure that your product provides a seamless user experience. This could involve regular cross-team meetings, joint planning sessions, or even restructuring teams to be cross-functional.</p><p>Your architecture may have to evolve to support this more integrated approach. For example, you may decide to use a full-stack development approach where each team is responsible for both front-end and back-end development for a certain part of the user journey. This can lead to a product architecture that is more aligned with the user's needs and can adapt more quickly to changes in those needs.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="code-architecture">Code Architecture<a class="hash-link" href="#code-architecture" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>At the code level, the User-Centric Conway Maneuver involves considering how the communication and collaboration styles of individual team members can influence the design of system components. This is where the understanding of your target user and their journey can guide the design of individual features or components.</p><p>If a developer tends to work in isolation on a feature, this could result in a component that does not integrate well with the rest of the system or does not meet user needs effectively. To address this, you may need to encourage more collaboration and communication within your team.</p><p>For instance, you could use pair programming or code reviews to ensure that all team members have input into feature development. This can lead to code architecture that is more cohesive and adaptable, and that better reflects the needs of the user.</p><p>Remember, these are just examples, and your actual actions will depend on the specific needs and structure of your organization.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="user-centric-conway-maneuver-action-plan">User-Centric Conway Maneuver Action Plan<a class="hash-link" href="#user-centric-conway-maneuver-action-plan" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>You should now be aware that Conway's law can impact your organization unconsciously. Based on our multi-layered view, let's focus on the user-centric Conway maneuver:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="global-architecture-1">Global Architecture<a class="hash-link" href="#global-architecture-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In this layer, you need to know what your business value is for your users to align to it, as it will likely change the least after you achieve a product-market fit. This knowledge can fuel your organizational and architectural changes. The knowledge required is not technical, but you should at least have defined your target user and their journey.</p><p>After defining these models, we will understand the business better, and we can map some new knowledge to reorganize and re-architect. Some possible actions from the examples we saw in the previous section:</p><ul><li><strong>Reorganize Non-technical departments:</strong> If there is no communication between marketing and operations, they need to work closer. This could involve having weekly syncs or a common leadership/organization, so their objectives are aligned.</li><li><strong>Technical departments:</strong> In the case of horizontal slicing, moving to a more user-centric environment could reorganize teams to be multifunctional and value stream aligned.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="product-architecture-1">Product Architecture<a class="hash-link" href="#product-architecture-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In the context of a User-Centric Conway Maneuver, the product architecture level requires a focus on how the various teams collaborate to deliver a product that fulfills user needs. This could involve regular cross-team meetings, joint planning sessions, or even restructuring teams to be more cross-functional.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="code-architecture-1">Code Architecture<a class="hash-link" href="#code-architecture-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>At the code level, the User-Centric Conway Maneuver involves considering how the communication and collaboration styles of individual team members can influence the design of system components.

While the experience and skill of your hires certainly contribute to the quality of work, the architecture of the systems you develop will be significantly influenced by your organizational communication patterns. Hence, you will have to apply the maneuver or none depending on if you accept, mitigate, or want to pivot on the tradeoffs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The value that software teams bring to an organization stretches far beyond the lines of code they write. Recognizing and leveraging these additional contributions can significantly enhance the impact and success of projects. Here’s a closer look at the diverse values software teams offer:</p><ol><li><strong>Identifying the Problems:</strong> The first step in any software project isn't to start coding, but to understand the problem being solved. This means engaging with stakeholders, conducting market research, and performing competitive analysis. A profound understanding of the issue helps in crafting solutions that are not just technically sound, but also relevant and useful.</li><li><strong>Validating the Business Case:</strong> Before a single line of code is written, it's critical to validate the business case for the project. This involves analyzing the potential return on investment, exploring the market demand, and considering various business models. Tools like the Lean Canvas can help in structuring these thoughts and ensuring that the project is viable from a business perspective.</li><li><strong>Exploring Solutions Beyond Code:</strong> Not every issue requires a complex, coded solution. Occasionally, the answer might lie in utilizing existing platforms, integrating with third-party services, or even creating a non-technical process. For instance, automating tasks through existing tools or leveraging no-code/low-code platforms can be both cost-effective and efficient.</li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-process-of-creating-new-solutions">The Process of Creating New Solutions<a class="hash-link" href="#the-process-of-creating-new-solutions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Tu fit the value of a team we have defined. This process involves several key steps designed to validate the business case, explore efficient development alternatives, and ensure the solution effectively addresses user needs without unnecessarily reinventing the wheel.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the realm of software engineering organizations, the synergy and coherence of a department are often the driving forces of success and innovation. As an engineering leader, I've witnessed the transformative power of establishing common practices across teams. </p><p>These practices streamline operations and foster a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement. The key lies in identifying and implementing a “minimum common denominator” of practices that all teams can adhere to, ensuring consistency while accommodating the diverse nature of our projects and teams.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-importance-of-common-practices"><strong>The Importance of Common Practices</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#the-importance-of-common-practices" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Common practices serve as a shared language and methodology that bridge the gaps between different teams within a software engineering department. They ensure that despite the varied nature of our work—be it developing new features, fixing bugs, or innovating on technology—there is a foundational set of standards and processes that everyone understands and follows. This common ground enhances efficiency, as teams can seamlessly collaborate or transition between projects without the friction of having to learn entirely new ways of working.</p><p>Moreover, these practices lay the groundwork for a culture of quality and accountability. When everyone adheres to a set of agreed-upon standards, it elevates the overall quality of output. It also simplifies onboarding new team members, as there is a clear set of practices they can learn and adapt to from day one.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="navigating-risk-of-overshoot-or-undershoot">Navigating Risk of overshoot or undershoot<a class="hash-link" href="#navigating-risk-of-overshoot-or-undershoot" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In the quest to harmonize operations within a software engineering department, striking the right balance between implementing common practices and allowing team-specific practices. Both extremes—having too many common practices or none—pose significant risks that can hinder a team's, and ultimately organization's ability, efficiency, or creativity. </p><p>Let's explore these risks in detail:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-risks-of-too-many-common-practices">The Risks of Too Many Common Practices<a class="hash-link" href="#the-risks-of-too-many-common-practices" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Stifled Creativity</strong>: Over-standardization can create an environment where teams and their members feel their creativity and problem-solving abilities are constrained by rigid guidelines. This can dampen innovation, as teams may be less inclined to explore novel solutions that fall outside established practices.</li><li><strong>Reduced Flexibility</strong>: Too many common practices can make it difficult for teams to adapt to specific project needs or unique challenges. This lack of flexibility can lead to inefficiencies, as teams are forced to follow processes that may not be optimal for their current context.</li><li><strong>One-Size-Fits-All Pitfall</strong>: Software projects can vary greatly in terms of scope, complexity, and objectives. A heavy-handed approach to standardization fails to acknowledge these differences, potentially leading to suboptimal approaches and solutions.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-risks-of-too-many-common-practices-1">The Risks of Too Many Common Practices<a class="hash-link" href="#the-risks-of-too-many-common-practices-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Stifled Creativity</strong>: Over-standardization can create an environment where teams and their members feel their creativity and problem-solving abilities are constrained by rigid guidelines.

This can result in integration challenges, technical debt, and a steep learning curve for team members transitioning between projects.</li><li><strong>Knowledge Silos and Isolation</strong>: The absence of shared practices can lead to knowledge silos, where expertise and solutions are not effectively shared across the department. This isolation can hinder collaboration and slow down problem-solving and innovation.</li><li><strong>Quality Control Challenges</strong>: Without a baseline of common practices, ensuring consistent quality across projects becomes a daunting task. This can affect the reliability and maintainability of the software produced, impacting customer satisfaction and trust.</li><li><strong>Complexity in Creating Coherent Systems</strong>: A lack of common practices complicates the development of systems that work seamlessly together, leading to disjointed user experiences.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="defining-a-minimum-common-denominator"><strong>Defining a Minimum Common Denominator</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#defining-a-minimum-common-denominator" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>With these risks in mind. The challenge lies in defining a set of practices that is broad enough to cover the essential aspects of our work, yet flexible enough to allow for the unique needs and creativity of each team. This involves:</p><ul><li><strong>Identifying Core Practices</strong>: Focus on establishing a core set of practices that address critical aspects of software development, such as languages, coding standards, version control, and testing. These practices should form the backbone of your department's operations, ensuring consistency and quality.</li><li><strong>Allowing for Flexibility</strong>: Encourage teams to adapt and supplement these core practices with methodologies that suit their specific project needs and challenges. This flexibility supports creativity and innovation, allowing teams to find the best solutions.</li><li><strong>Fostering a Culture of Collaboration</strong>: Promote an environment where teams are encouraged to share their successes and learnings from adapting common practices. This can help evolve and refine your core practices over time, ensuring they remain relevant and effective.</li></ul><p>By defining and adhering to these minimum common practices, software engineering departments can achieve a balance between uniformity and flexibility. This balance is crucial for fostering an environment where teams can work efficiently and innovate freely, driving the organization towards its goals with cohesion and excellence.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="creating-an-organization-specific-technology-radar-to-define-common-practices">Creating an Organization-Specific Technology Radar to Define Common Practices<a class="hash-link" href="#creating-an-organization-specific-technology-radar-to-define-common-practices" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>To tailor common practices to the unique needs and strategic goals of a software engineering organization, developing an organization-specific Technology Radar can be an invaluable approach. Inspired by the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar, this framework allows organizations to systematically evaluate and adopt technologies and methodologies that best fit their context. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to implement this framework:</p><ol><li><strong>Define the Radar Structure:</strong> Similar to the ThoughtWorks model, organize your Radar into quadrants that are relevant to your organization, such as Tools, Languages &amp; Frameworks, Platforms, and Practices &amp; Techniques. Within each quadrant, use rings to categorize technologies or practices based on their adoption stage: Explore, Adopt, Trial, and Hold.</li><li><strong>Gather Input:</strong> Solicit input from across the organization to identify technologies, tools, and practices currently in use, as well as those being considered for future projects. Encourage teams to share their experiences, challenges, and successes with different technologies.</li><li><strong>Evaluate and Categorize:</strong> Define an organization wide session to evaluate the collected input based on criteria such as strategic fit, potential benefits, current maturity, and the organization’s ability to support and implement the technology or practice. Based on this evaluation, items are placed into the appropriate quadrant and ring of the Radar.</li><li><strong>Communicate and Implement:</strong> Share the Technology Radar and the derived common practices with the entire engineering department.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the dynamic field of engineering, effective decision-making is crucial. From day-to-day team choices to strategic departmental shifts that align with company-wide objectives, understanding how to navigate these decisions is key to fostering a productive, innovative, and cohesive engineering environment. A well-established decision-making process is vital for several key reasons:</p><ol><li><strong>Clarity and Efficiency</strong>: It provides clear guidelines and roles, streamlining decision-making and saving time and resources.</li><li><strong>Accountability and Quality</strong>: Assigning clear roles enhances accountability, leading to more informed and thoughtful decisions.</li><li><strong>Transparency and Trust</strong>: A transparent process builds trust among team members, ensuring decisions are made fairly.</li></ol><p>In every organization, decisions are made daily across various levels, to help shape the direction we collectively strive for.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="decision-stratums">Decision Stratum’s<a class="hash-link" href="#decision-stratums" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-team-level">The Team Level<a class="hash-link" href="#the-team-level" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Decisions at the team level often involve immediate, tactical issues related to required execution, technology choices, or problem-solving methods. </p><blockquote><p><strong>Empower your teams</strong> by encouraging autonomy and ownership of decisions within their scope. </p></blockquote><p>Implement a <strong>decentralized decision-making process</strong>, where the teams and its members can make decisions based on their expertise and understanding of the context. This approach enhances agility and accelerates the development process.
However, ensure these decisions align with broader domain and departmental goals through regular sync-ups and transparent communication channels.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Framework</strong></th><th>Classic Brainstorming</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Action Steps</strong></td><td>1. <strong>Set Clear Objectives</strong>: Begin by clearly defining the problem or topic you're brainstorming about.

As organizations grow and become more complex, the need for clear communication and defined roles becomes paramount to avoid confusion and ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals.
A key strategy in achieving this alignment is to ensure that decision-making processes are transparent and involve the right stakeholders at the right time. This involves not only identifying who needs to be involved in making decisions but also clarifying the extent of their involvement and the expectations from them.
Effective alignment means that strategic decisions made at the top level are informed by insights from all relevant parts of the organization and that these decisions are effectively communicated and implemented at the operational level.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Framework</strong></th><th><strong>Balanced Scorecard</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Action Steps</strong></td><td>1. <strong>Identify Tasks and Processes:</strong> List all tasks, activities, or decisions that need to be made within the department.

            <description><![CDATA[Are leaders and managers important for organizational success?]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>TL;DR;</p><p>In essence, leadership and management are two sides of the same coin, each playing a critical role in guiding teams and individuals towards achieving their potential and realizing organizational objectives. By building trust and taking control in measure, you empower your teams to innovate, perform, and thrive in an ever-evolving landscape.</p></blockquote><p>Have you ever worked in an organization that either seems too lax on the process or too stiff? What is behind that lack of balance? Are Leaders &amp; Managers roles completely contradictory?</p><p>In the realm of organizational success, the distinction between leadership and management is not just semantics. It's foundational to how teams and individuals achieve their goals. While management is essential for ensuring tasks are completed, budgets are adhered to, and deadlines are met, leadership goes a step beyond, it cultivates an environment of trust, vision, and empowerment.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-essence-of-leadership-building-trust">The Essence of Leadership: Building Trust<a class="hash-link" href="#the-essence-of-leadership-building-trust" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Leadership is inherently about building trust. It's a leader's responsibility to create a safe environment where team members feel valued, heard, and encouraged to contribute their best work. Trust is not built overnight but is developed through consistent actions, transparency, and an open dialogue. Here are a few ways leaders can build trust:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Empathy and Understanding</strong>: Leaders who show empathy and genuinely understand their team's challenges and needs foster a deeper connection, demonstrating they value their team members not just as employees but as individuals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consistency in Words and Actions</strong>: Trust is nurtured when leaders follow through on their promises and demonstrate integrity in all actions, proving they are reliable and trustworthy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Empowering Others</strong>: By delegating meaningful tasks and showing confidence in their team's abilities, leaders empower their colleagues, which builds trust and cultivates a sense of ownership.</p></li><li><p><strong>Leading by Example</strong>: Actions often speak louder than words. When leaders embody the values, work ethic, and attitude they wish to see in their teams, they set a powerful example that encourages others to follow suit. Leading by example bridges the gap between directives and action, showing that leaders are willing to do what they ask of others.</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-role-of-management-taking-control">The Role of Management: Taking Control<a class="hash-link" href="#the-role-of-management-taking-control" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Management, while often seen in a less glamorous light, is crucial for organizational success. Managers take control by organizing, planning, and directing resources to meet objectives. Control, in this context, means ensuring that processes are efficient, objectives are clear, and outcomes are predictable. Here's how management takes control:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Setting Clear Goals and Expectations</strong>: Managers excel at clarifying goals and setting expectations, ensuring everyone knows what needs to be done and by when.</p></li><li><p><strong>Monitoring Progress and Making Adjustments</strong>: Control involves keeping a close eye on progress, identifying issues early, and adjusting plans as necessary to stay on course.</p></li><li><p><strong>Efficiency and Optimization</strong>: Managers focus on optimizing resources, reducing waste, and improving efficiency, ensuring that the team can achieve its objectives with the resources available.</p></li><li><p><strong>Keeping Everyone in Sync</strong>: Effective managers facilitate communication across departments, share insights and updates, and ensure that their team’s objectives align with broader company goals.</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-imbalance-of-leadership-without-management-and-vice-versa">The Imbalance of Leadership Without Management, and Vice Versa<a class="hash-link" href="#the-imbalance-of-leadership-without-management-and-vice-versa" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Seeing both roles as contradictory tends to push organizations towards failure. Organizational success requires a delicate balance between leadership and management. An imbalance, where one exists without the other, can lead to challenges that hinder a team’s or organization’s ability to reach its full potential.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Leadership Without Management</strong>: Leadership focused on building trust and vision without the grounding force of management can lead to a lack of direction and inefficiencies. While teams may feel inspired and valued, the absence of structured planning, goal-setting, and resource management can result in missed deadlines, unmet objectives, and wasted potential. In essence, the drive and motivation fostered by leadership need the rudder of management to steer the organization towards its goals effectively.</p></li><li><p><strong>Management Without Leadership</strong>: Conversely, management without leadership often leads to a rigid, uninspired work environment where tasks are completed, and objectives are met, but there’s little room for innovation, engagement, or personal growth. This scenario can enforce a culture of merely 'going through the motions' rather than thriving. Teams may achieve short-term goals but at the cost of long-term engagement and loyalty. The vision, inspiration, and trust-building aspects of leadership are critical for cultivating an environment where employees feel connected to their work and motivated to contribute their best.</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="finding-the-right-balance-by-bridging-leadership-and-management">Finding the Right Balance By Bridging Leadership and Management<a class="hash-link" href="#finding-the-right-balance-by-bridging-leadership-and-management" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The most effective leaders are those who can blend the visionary, trust-building aspects of leadership with the pragmatic, control-oriented nature of management. Here are a few ways to bridge the gap:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Communicate Vision and Purpose</strong>: Share the bigger picture and why work matters, connecting daily tasks to overarching goals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Foster an Environment of Growth</strong>: While maintaining control over the essentials, encourage innovation and risk-taking within parameters that ensure alignment with goals and values.</p></li><li><p><strong>Practice Emotional Intelligence</strong>: Recognize your emotions and those of others to manage interactions and communications effectively, blending empathy with decisiveness.</p></li></ul><p>The synergy of inspirational leadership and effective management ensures that teams are not only motivated to reach their goals but are also equipped with the strategy, resources, and direction to do so.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>psychological safety is essential for the success of software development teams. By fostering open communication and encouraging a culture of learning and innovation, teams can work more efficiently, effectively, and creatively. By promoting psychological safety, managers and leaders can help their team members to reach their full potential and take the team to the next level.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="long-version">Long Version<a class="hash-link" href="#long-version" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-psychological-safety">What is psychological safety<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-psychological-safety" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>Psychological safety refers to the belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes.

Software development organizations are no exception.</p><p>One of the main benefits of psychological safety is the ability to foster open and honest communication. When team members feel safe to speak up, they are more likely to share their thoughts and ideas, which can lead to more efficient problem-solving and decision-making. In a field that is constantly evolving and where new technologies and approaches are continually emerging, it is essential to stay up-to-date and adapt to change.</p><p>Furthermore, it allows for creativity and innovation to flourish. When team members feel secure in their ability to express themselves, they are more likely to think outside the box and come up with new and unique solutions. In software development, this can be the difference between the success and failure of a project.</p><p>However, creating a culture of psychological safety is not always easy. It requires active effort and commitment from everyone on the team, including managers and leaders. One important step is to actively listen to and encourage open dialogue among team members. Managers should also create an environment where mistakes are viewed as opportunities for learning, not as failures.</p><p>Another important step is to establish clear guidelines and expectations for communication and behavior within the team. This can include things like setting ground rules for respectful dialogue and providing training on active listening and conflict resolution.</p><p>Finally, it is essential to hold every one on the team accountable for maintaining a culture of psychological safety. This includes managers, who should lead by example and model the behavior they expect from their team.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[In the current world of development we solve all with APIs, is it becoming an overused practice?]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The singleton pattern has got a bad reputation over the years due to be widely overused in the incorrect use cases. With the proliferation of microservices, <strong>have APIs become the new singleton?</strong></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-problem">The Problem<a class="hash-link" href="#the-problem" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>APIs, or application programming interfaces, have become a ubiquitous part of modern software development. They allow different systems and applications to communicate with one another, enabling the creation of complex, interconnected systems that can share data and functionality. However, there has been a growing concern that APIs are being overused, leading to a proliferation of unnecessarily complex and fragile systems that are difficult to maintain and scale.</p><p>One reason for the perceived overuse of APIs is the ease with which they can be implemented. With the abundance of API management tools and frameworks available, it is relatively straightforward to expose a set of functionality as an API and make it available to other systems. This has led to a proliferation of APIs, many of which are redundant or unnecessary, adding unnecessary complexity to the overall system.</p><p>Another issue is the lack of standardization in the API ecosystem. Each API is typically designed to meet the specific needs of the system it was created for, resulting in a wide variety of different designs and conventions. This can make it difficult for developers to understand and use APIs from other systems, as they may have to learn and adapt to new conventions and patterns each time they encounter a new API.</p><p>In addition to these issues, the reliance on APIs can also lead to fragile systems that are difficult to maintain and scale. When multiple systems are tightly coupled through APIs, a change to one system can have cascading effects on others, leading to unexpected behavior and potential failures. This can make it difficult to make changes or updates to a system without the risk of breaking something else.</p><p>There are also concerns about the security of APIs. As they allow systems to communicate with one another, they can also provide a potential entry point for attackers to gain access to sensitive data or functionality. Properly securing APIs can be a complex and time-consuming task, and if not done correctly, can lead to significant vulnerabilities.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-solution">The Solution<a class="hash-link" href="#the-solution" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>So, what can be done to address these issues? One solution is to use APIs more judiciously, carefully evaluating whether an API is truly necessary before implementing it. This can help reduce the overall complexity of the system and make it easier to maintain and scale. </p><p>It's also important to adopt API design standards and guidelines, which can help ensure that APIs are consistent and easy to understand and use. Finally, proper API security practices should be implemented to protect against potential vulnerabilities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Macro Infrastructure due to Microservice Obsession the over-engineering of our age]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-context">The Context<a class="hash-link" href="#the-context" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Cloud and infrastructure as code have revolutionized our industry. They allowed us to be able to procure infrastructure in a simple, adaptable way.<br>
<!-- -->This allowed us to move from writing huge monolithic applications to write microservices that interact between them.<br>
<!-- -->One of the most accepted definition of a microservice can be expressed as:</p><blockquote><p>A self-contained portion of code that does not share resources with other services, can be deployed independently, and should be easy to rewrite in a small portion of time.</p></blockquote><p>This sounds great when we talk about individual parts of a software projects. Nevertheless, when thinking about systems and how they operate, There is a point to make about granularity as software does never work fully isolated. It requires interactions with other systems to fulfill their purpose.</p><p>Most of the monolithic applications of the past had an issue of being over-engineered to allow changes that might never happen.</p><p>Could that also happen with microservices?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-issues">The Issues<a class="hash-link" href="#the-issues" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="clarity-of-the-domain">Clarity Of The Domain<a class="hash-link" href="#clarity-of-the-domain" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>When a system grows too much in small pieces, it becomes more and more complex to understand the big picture.<br>
<!-- -->When pieces are too small, domain events start becoming exchange of information in between nodes of a network. All this removes cohesion on the knowledge over the domain of a system, making it difficult to grasp the real intention and capabilities of concepts and actors across a system.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="babel-tower-issue">Babel tower Issue<a class="hash-link" href="#babel-tower-issue" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The more parts a system has, the less heterogeneous it becomes. This at the same time translates into a more complex environment with more integrations, frameworks and bigger learning curves that affects delivery. There need to be a balance of when and where in a system a new technology is added. Decisions must be based on needs and not on preferences.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="implicit-runtime-dependencies">Implicit runtime dependencies<a class="hash-link" href="#implicit-runtime-dependencies" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The more a system get split, the more dependency on certain node it will have. This tends to cause more dependencies in between the pieces of your infrastructure-based puzzle where you start having god infrastructure points that become single point of failure, or you have a chain of dependent infra that need to be deployed in a go or certain order.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hidden-complexity">Hidden Complexity<a class="hash-link" href="#hidden-complexity" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The more your microservice environment grows, the more it requires a growing support infrastructure for monitoring, alerting and other services not used as part of the main system. This normally is a separate effort which has its cost. The more a system grows, those hidden complexities become a dependency for all the nodes in the system, making it a complex task to evolve and change those dependencies.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-if-yagni">Why… if YAGNI<a class="hash-link" href="#why-if-yagni" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>One of the main ideas of microservices was to be able to validate assumptions fast. Before bootstrapping new services or infrastructure, there is a need to ask ourselves about the existence of a service or infrastructure that contains the domain knowledge required for the experiment in the current ecosystem. If we are not careful, experiments won't be experiments. They will be MVPs, where domain knowledge is re-implemented, just for having it as a standalone node on the system.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="repeating-yourself">Repeating Yourself<a class="hash-link" href="#repeating-yourself" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>When we create pieces of code that are independent, there is always a certain level of bootstrapping that is required and repeated in each node of our systems. This will cause not only a set of duplicated code, but also has a development time cost attached to it. Bootstrapping a project in a high granularity system can be complex to standardize.</p><p>Microservices, the cloud, and infrastructure as a service have definitely revolutionized our industry, nevertheless as in everything there is a need for balance. Making sure we use the right tool for the job, and we don't over-engineer things, not only at a code level but also at infrastructure level, as everything has a cost.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In conclusion, a macro infrastructure due to microservice obsession can lead to increased complexity and overhead costs, as well as challenges in making changes and updates to the system. While microservices can offer benefits such as increased scalability and flexibility, it is important for organizations to carefully consider their specific needs and choose the right level of granularity for their architecture.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have observed quite a few articles lately that elaborate on issues with TDD.

This brings a <strong>reducing time to market</strong>, by reducing the <strong>accidental complexity</strong>.</p><p>When doing TDD most developers have the complexity of letting go their <strong>egos</strong>, the problem when people fight against the practices is because they think to know better. Nevertheless, it tends to <strong>generate waste</strong> because most code optimizations tend to be premature and most extensibility points will never be modified.</p><p>There are places where TDD does not fit, for example while investigating a technology through a spike or PoC because in these cases, the person is exploring knowledge not generating value.

I will go straight to the point on comparing Git Flow (a <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">legacy strategy</a> that most companies use) and Trunk-Based Development.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="gitflow-the-bad--the-ugly">Gitflow: The Bad &amp; The Ugly<a class="hash-link" href="#gitflow-the-bad--the-ugly" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Why do I call it the bad and the ugly? Because it does not allow you to achieve Continuous Deployment.<br>
<!-- -->The idea is that every developer works isolated on their branch, validate on their branch and ask through a merge request to add their code to the X stage branch.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alvarolorente.dev/img/blog/gitflow-diagram-768x973.png" class="img_ev3q"><br>
<!-- -->There are multiple issues with this:</p><ul><li>Code does not exist isolated, we don't deploy isolated code, so the isolated test is not valid as it will require retesting.</li><li>The peer review process happens at the end, causing a very slow feedback loop. Having to rewrite code that could be avoided.</li><li>The more time the branch lives, the more it diverges from the original behavior and the more complex it is to merge.</li><li>Merging can cause complex conflicts that require revalidation, and it might have side effect in other features. </li><li>As there needs to be validations of the merges, it's normal to have multiple environments that give a false sense of security, increases the $ cost and increases the lead time.</li><li>Egos and preferences become part of the review process, as it has become an 'accepted' practice that the 'experts' or 'leads' do the reviews.</li></ul><p>All of this is red tape to go through is a problem that makes delivery slower, and create a lack of ownership mentality farther away from what happen to the individual branch.</p><p>This affects mostly negatively, most of DORA 4 metrics:</p><ul><li>❌ <strong>Deployment frequency</strong></li><li>❌ <strong>Lead Time for change</strong></li><li>❌ <strong>Mean Time To Recovery</strong></li></ul><p>Is there a simpler and better way to collaborate on code way?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="trunk-based-development-the-good">Trunk-Based Development: The Good<a class="hash-link" href="#trunk-based-development-the-good" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>What happens if we all commit to the same branch.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alvarolorente.dev/img/blog/trunk.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Most of the expressed issues are solved, in this scenario by:</p><ul><li>Code is never isolated, as we all push code to the same place.</li><li>Teams that do this practices also practice pair programming, making the peer review process is continuous and synchronous.</li><li>As individuals push multiple times a day, merge conflicts are non-existent or small.</li><li>Does not require revalidation, as validation is a continuous stream in the single environment.</li><li>No ego environment tent to appear as there is no centralize approver of code, so it's not a matter of preference but a team effort and ownership.</li></ul><p>As we have seen before, having unfinished code does not need to affect users, as it is common practice to use feature flags and/or branching by abstraction.</p><p>This affect the next DORA 4 metrics:</p><ul><li>✔️ <strong>Deployment frequency</strong></li><li>✔️ <strong>Lead Time for change</strong></li><li>✔️ <strong>Mean Time To Recovery</strong></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Simplicity is king.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before we enable code for our clients, we need to test and validate it does what is expected.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that we know where our code lives, we need to make sure our users get access to the features. For this, we need to get our code to the environment we want to deploy to, and control the rollout (if you are not a big bang release fan).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bluegreen-deployment-getting-to-prod-with-0-downtime">Blue/Green Deployment: Getting to prod with 0 downtime<a class="hash-link" href="#bluegreen-deployment-getting-to-prod-with-0-downtime" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>What is this?, The concept is simple, we have a set of machines (ex. blue) where we currently have our app running, and we want to deploy. The intent is to create a new set of machines (ex. green) where our new version of the code will run. We would like to validate as much as possible (ex. automated e2e tests) that this new version is up to par with the previous one before moving the traffic and destroy the previous version.</p><p>You can see the process in the next graph:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alvarolorente.dev/img/blog/blue_green.jpeg" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>With this, we are trying to achieve a 0 downtime while deploying a new version of our code. This is critical for teams that practice continuous deployment, as you want to avoid having systems down as you deploy multiple times a day.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="enabling-feature-access-to-users">Enabling feature access to users<a class="hash-link" href="#enabling-feature-access-to-users" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>there are multiple ways to enable access to users, in between them:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="big-bang-releases">Big Bang Releases<a class="hash-link" href="#big-bang-releases" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>This is the plug and pray solution.

With this, we can monitor this canary instances and act if any issue happens, we reduce the blast radius of issues to only the users who go through that server.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alvarolorente.dev/img/blog/canary.jpeg" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This affect the next DORA 4 metrics:</p><ul><li>✔️ <strong>Change Failure Rate</strong></li></ul><p>This approach provides us a way to reduce the blast radius from a big bang release.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our services need to run somewhere, so our users can access it. It's a very common practices to have multiple environments like dev, staging, and prod.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we start our journey towards continuous integration &amp; delivery, the first thing to take in count is the mentality. There are a few of them that will make or break our intent. Let's see the most important and also some practices.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mentality">Mentality<a class="hash-link" href="#mentality" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="you-build-it-you-run-it">You build it, you run it<a class="hash-link" href="#you-build-it-you-run-it" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alvarolorente.dev/img/blog/run_it.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></p><blockquote><p>create a DevOps culture, not a Devs vs Ops</p></blockquote><p>This mentality is the idea that the same people who develop the software re in charge to maintain it in good health by observing it.</p><p>For many years, this was not the case. Operations &amp; development were handled by different teams. This caused a dystopian situation where each group had a different goal:</p><ul><li><strong>Devs</strong>: deliver as fast as possible.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a series I am really looking forward to writing. I have been doing this presentation for the last 3 years in multiple places.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="am-i-crazy">Am I Crazy?<a class="hash-link" href="#am-i-crazy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The answer is no, most of the thing you will see on this series comes from practices derived from Extreme Programming, that show how to build quality and value into products. So bear with me for some time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="motivation">Motivation<a class="hash-link" href="#motivation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>A few years ago, I read the book Accelerate that is derived of the analysis of the state of DevOps report that happens in a regular basis.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alvarolorente.dev/img/blog/accelerate.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The book does not speak only about technology but also speaks about communication, organization, etc. And how this affects effectiveness in teams &amp; companies. I recommend reading the entire book.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-key-metrics">4 key metrics<a class="hash-link" href="#4-key-metrics" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Nevertheless, most of the people resume this book (erroneously) in the next table.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alvarolorente.dev/img/blog/key_metrics.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>It does a comparison on a what are called the 4 key metrics, and provide a classification of performance (teams &amp; companies, since 2017 this classification has evolved).</p><p>What does these 4 key metrics  mean:</p><ul><li><strong>Deployment frequency</strong>: is how often does the team deploy to <strong>production</strong>.</li><li><strong>Lead Time for change</strong>: is how much time does a story take to get to <strong>production</strong>.</li><li><strong>Mean Time To Recovery</strong>: is how fast can we solve a production issues.</li><li><strong>Change Failure Rate</strong>: is how frequently do we break things in production.</li></ul><p>All this metrics is helping teams understand their feedback cycle and stability. In the case of the team, I currently work with:</p><ul><li><strong>Deployment Frequency</strong>: once per commit to trunk (while doing trunk-based development) what ends up translating to a few times per day.</li><li><strong>Lead Time for change:</strong> below 1h. We can activate a feature as soon as the code is deployed by the CI/CD using feature flags.</li><li><strong>Mean Time To Recovery</strong>: In minutes. We can activate and deactivate feature flags on the fly if any of the code breaks, and we have a good observability and alarming, so we are the first one to notice.</li><li><strong>Change Failure Rate</strong>: We don't optimize for this, as MTTR is more important for us (I will explain why later). Nevertheless, we currently only had 2 minor production issues in the last year, so we are way below 1%. Our CI/CD validations help a lot on this.</li></ul><p>The intent of this series is to share the Extreme programming practices that we use to achieve being on the <a href="https://www.devops-research.com/quickcheck.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">elite classification of DORA 4</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="note-of-caution">Note of Caution<a class="hash-link" href="#note-of-caution" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As this twitter thread shows, this is not one size fits all, the challenges of a team are not the challenges of another one.  There is no silver bullet or common root cause to the issue, and each team should use this metrics to track improvements in an unbiased way. For this, the 4 key metrics do not mean anything at company level and should not be used to compare teams.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alvarolorente.dev/img/blog/metrics_caution.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="next">Next<a class="hash-link" href="#next" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In the following installments, I will walk backwards from having something in production and how to keep it running in a healthy manner stress-free up to coding techniques that enable Trunk-based development.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In software development, over the last years we always talk about on cross-functional teams, as a good split of responsibilities to provide autonomy in teams.

            <description><![CDATA[how can we define what is the scope of a service, event storming is here to help us]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On our previous installments, we discussed the smells that can happen when splitting microservices, and the strategies that exist to make them as independent as possible. But how do we define boundaries? How do we define the process that our microservice is in charge off?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="event-storming">Event Storming<a class="hash-link" href="#event-storming" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Event storming is a technique that is part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DDD</a>. But, what is Event storming?, the definition on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_storming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> is:</p><blockquote><p>A workshop-based method to quickly find out what is happening in the domain of a software program. The business process is "stormed out" as a series of domain events.</p></blockquote><p>This process is run with stickies in a physical or digital board during a session, and requires the 'experts' on the process to be present to provide the context what/whom/how. The outcome is an understanding of the <strong>business process</strong>, not the technical one. To be able to separate them into different steps with clear responsibilities.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-by-step-guide">Step-By-Step Guide<a class="hash-link" href="#step-by-step-guide" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>let's do an example of how a company sets up our internet connection</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prepare-a-board-and-the-people-for-the-session">Prepare a board and the people for the session<a class="hash-link" href="#prepare-a-board-and-the-people-for-the-session" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Event storming requires people to share a common view and brainstorm and discuss on it. This process takes to count time as a dimension. And has multiple types of stickies that can be used.<br>
<!-- -->You can see an example board on the next image:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alvarolorente.dev/img/blog/event-storming.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Regarding the Stickies, their color represent a specific meaning<!-- -->[<!-- -->1<!-- -->]<!-- -->:</p><ul><li><strong>Events (orange):</strong> Represent the factual events and anything that is relevant to a domain expert.</li><li><strong>Commands (blue):</strong> These are requests to do something. They can originate from a user or system or by another event.</li><li><strong>System (pink):</strong> These represent systems involved in the domain. They may issue commands or receive commands along with triggering events.</li><li><strong>User (yellow):</strong> These are human users involved in the process. They may be a single person or a department/team.</li><li><strong>Aggregate (tan):</strong> This is the first level of categorization and can be thought of as the “thing” that a group of events operates on.</li><li><strong>Read Model (green):</strong> This represents data that may be critical for a user or system to decide.</li><li><strong>Policy (gray):</strong> These represent standards or rules that may need to be executed, such as rules for a compliance policy.</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="define-the-events-of-your-system">Define the <strong>Events</strong> of your system<a class="hash-link" href="#define-the-events-of-your-system" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Events are the most important information of our board. They represent facts regarding the process and helps encapsulate the knowledge of the 'experts'.<br>
<!-- -->As we mention before, time is a significant dimension. A process always happens in a period of time. Starting by organizing this 'things' that happen in a timeline is a good way to start.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alvarolorente.dev/img/blog/event-storming-map-events-drawio.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In our example, you can see on the previous image we go from checking coverage, to creating a user, to creating a contract and connecting our user to the network.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="identify-the-systems-involved-optional">Identify the <strong>Systems</strong> involved (Optional)<a class="hash-link" href="#identify-the-systems-involved-optional" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The intent of this step is to identify the existing systems and their interdependency. When we discuss systems, they can be internal or external.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alvarolorente.dev/img/blog/event-storming-map-systems-drawio.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In our example, all starts with the website, but soon enough it becomes apparent most of the process is taken care by the monolith.</p><p>This step is optional in the case you have a greenfield. Nevertheless, I highly recommend it if you are splitting a monolith.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="add-the-actors">Add the <strong>Actors</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#add-the-actors" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>These are real people who are part of the process, they tend to be the starting point of a chain of events, or even on a manual process we are trying to automate the executors of the individual step.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alvarolorente.dev/img/blog/event-storming-map-actors-drawio.png" class="img_ev3q"><br>
<!-- -->In our case, the user is the one starting the process, but there needs to be a technician doing the last steps manually.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="connect-the-dots-with-commands">Connect the dots with <strong>Commands</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#connect-the-dots-with-commands" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Now we are left with events that are done by someone and take effect in parts of our system. But we are missing the cause and effect that made this look this way.</p><p>Commands allow exactly this, is a specific action or decision that will push our system into a certain direction.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alvarolorente.dev/img/blog/event-storming-map-commands-drawio.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Commands can be positive or negative actions, causing bifurcation and showing different cases that our system needs to cope with.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="define-bounded-context">Define <strong>Bounded Context</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#define-bounded-context" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>now we are left to define where each of the sub-process that conform our system starts and ends. This is done by grouping the stickies with an enclosing and giving a noun + verb to it, as it's a sub-process and it evokes action.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alvarolorente.dev/img/blog/event-storming-bounded-contexts-drawio.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Now you have a set of split actions that can become their microservices and provide part of the process independently.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="create-capabilities-matrix-optional">Create <strong>Capabilities Matrix</strong> (Optional)<a class="hash-link" href="#create-capabilities-matrix-optional" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Now, with the bounded context, we can start defining the capabilities of our services.

<!-- -->This is not only a technical challenge, but an organizational challenge due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conway's law</a>. If we would like to be successful in splitting a monolith our communication, meaning the teams structure involved, need to resemble this target state.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alvarolorente.dev/img/blog/event-storming-goal-architecture-drawio.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="define-a-plan-on-how-to-split-the-monolith-optional">Define a <strong>plan</strong> on how to split the Monolith (Optional)<a class="hash-link" href="#define-a-plan-on-how-to-split-the-monolith-optional" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>A change so big as the one shown on the previous image can be overwhelming for an organization and create a paralysis and doubts.

            <description><![CDATA[how can we decouple services to avoid some common pitfalls]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the previous installment of this series, we discussed the pitfalls that could happen when we split a monolith into microservices. In specific, we talked about creating what are called microliths.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alvarolorente.dev/img/blog/microliths.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Given that you have followed the recommendations on designing your domains correctly. Today we are going to elaborate on patterns to remove that synchronous communication in between 'microservices'. This will help our services to become more resilient.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-patterns">The Patterns<a class="hash-link" href="#the-patterns" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="circuit-breakers">Circuit Breakers<a class="hash-link" href="#circuit-breakers" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The most simple solution we can go for is called <strong>circuit breakers</strong>. As it implies, is just a piece of code that upon multiple request failed to a downstream service will fail silently and allow service to resume their normal behavior.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alvarolorente.dev/img/blog/circuitbreakerdesignpattern.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>What are we solving and what are we letting unsolved:</p><ul><li>✔️ We don’t fail continuously if some other service fails.</li><li>❌ We silently don’t finish the entire process requested.</li><li>❌ We require all chain of dependencies to be called.</li><li>❌ We force other services to scale to our needs.</li><li>❌ Data is mutable, so errors will be propagated and not solvable.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="outbox-pattern">Outbox Pattern<a class="hash-link" href="#outbox-pattern" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The next level in solving our microlithic issue is to decouple our services using Pub/Sub to exchange models in between services.<br>
<!-- -->Our service will consume and store the necessary information to run the process locally, and will broadcast the outcome models. This will mean there will always be a strong consistency in the outbox, and eventual consistency on the service database (if it exists).</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alvarolorente.dev/img/blog/reactivemicroliths.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>What are we solving and what are we letting unsolved:</p><ul><li>✔️ We don’t fail continuously if some other service fails.</li><li>✔️ We always finish our process and promise the rest will be done.</li><li>✔️ We just require our service to do what we promise.</li><li>✔️ Fast services will be fast, and slow services can go slow.</li><li>❌ Data is mutable, so errors will be propagated and not solvable.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="event-sourcing">Event Sourcing<a class="hash-link" href="#event-sourcing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The last level is <strong>event sourcing</strong>. The idea is to use the events that generated a specific state and not use the calculated state that a service can provide us.</p><p>This allows a higher resilience due to the immutability of the data. In this case, calculation issues of the past can be solved, as we can reprocess the entire set of events that took us to a certain state.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alvarolorente.dev/img/blog/microsystems.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion-and-follow-ups">Conclusion and follow-ups<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion-and-follow-ups" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>These are some of the patterns that can make our services more independent and resilient. Nevertheless, each of them has a different complexity, meaning it also affects the complexity of our code. For this, we need to make sure we use the correct tool for the job.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-monolith">The Monolith<a class="hash-link" href="#the-monolith" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We have all at this point encounter the big service that jumpstarted the business. It's always good to find it or know it existed. It shows that there was an intent to not resolve every architectural problem before we even knew we had a business.</p><p>Nevertheless, it tends to outgrow itself and become more a pain than a solution. Some of these pains are:</p><ul><li>We all work on the same code base, and conflicts and side effects start to happen.</li><li>You need to release the entire solution, even if different teams have different cycles.</li><li>There are code freezes to go through validation cycles.</li><li>It scales as a whole, not only the portion that has an increase in traffic.</li></ul><p>Due to these pains, microservices were created. To give team/domain independence to create focused solutions on a business that has already been validated.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alvarolorente.dev/img/blog/monolith.JPG" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-microservices">The Microservices<a class="hash-link" href="#the-microservices" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Let's start with a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">definition of a microservice</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams.</p></blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3071208/188307797-7c30c8cb-bff7-4755-822b-7cf469cba372.JPG" alt="microservices" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>All sounds like flowers and happiness when we talk about microservice. Nevertheless, does microservices solve the entire issue by itself?</p><p>Have you encountered the next cases in a microservice architecture?</p><ul><li>Before we release a new version, we need to sync deploys with another team.</li><li>Our application was down, but is not our issue.</li><li>Our service was working and scaling fine until the team X started using us.</li><li>And more…</li></ul><p>What is happening?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="microliths">Microliths<a class="hash-link" href="#microliths" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The smells mention before are caused by what <a href="http://jonasboner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonas Boner</a> call Microliths, a great word for what is happening here.<br>
<!-- -->Even if we think this are 'independent' services, synchronous communication can cause side effects we don't want:</p><ul><li>There can be cascading events between your services.</li><li>Your domain boundaries are not clear because you don’t own the entire process.</li><li>Slow services are forced to scale by faster services requirements.</li><li>There is additional latency on the network calls.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://microlithalternatives.kanekotic.com/images/microliths.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-got-lost-in-translation">What got lost in translation?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-got-lost-in-translation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Having microliths comes from multiple misconceptions we have. Some of them are:</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="domains--resources">Domains != Resources<a class="hash-link" href="#domains--resources" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Every so often, when we divide the monolith, we think about domains being resources. Due to how we normally have divided API's and DB's as we think about splitting what already exists and not about extracting the processes being achieved.</p><p>When thinking about a microservice, we should think about what part of the process it is trying to solve, this will help us define good boundaries for our bounded context.</p><p>When we think in a process, data is secondary. The process will require different pieces of existing data to fulfill their capabilities, and it is ok for it to own its copy of what is needed to fulfill his mission.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="independence--single-source">Independence != Single Source<a class="hash-link" href="#independence--single-source" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>A single source of data does not mean independence, as whenever your software requires complementary data, it will have to acquire it from somewhere else, what means a direct  dependency. This also affects boundaries as you must enter other team's domain.</p><p>If you strive for independence, copy the information you require for your process, even if it exists somewhere else.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fast--synchronous">Fast != Synchronous<a class="hash-link" href="#fast--synchronous" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Humans think that a direct response is always faster than sending out a message. While occasionally this is true, in microservices this could start a cascade of synchronous calls from one service to the next one, leaving our users in a timeout limbo.</p><p>Think if really your system requires calling others directly or if you can message them to start their process.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="resilience--complete">Resilience != Complete<a class="hash-link" href="#resilience--complete" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Making sure the entire process has been completed, is normally confused by resiliency. Resiliency only refers to the capability to complete the process.<br>
<!-- -->If we have well-defined contracts in between our pieces, we don't need to finish things synchronously, we can promise our users things will happen. And let our services do their work at their speed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion-and-follow-ups">Conclusion and follow-ups<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion-and-follow-ups" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Are we doomed?<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://microlithalternatives.kanekotic.com/images/timetopanic.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The answer is no, we are not doomed! We can design our services with the correct division using some DDD tooling and also use the correct tools to decouple our microservices.<br>

to something like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>husky</code></a>, you will need to name your script something other than <code>"commit"</code> (e.g. <code>"cm": "cz"</code>). The reason is because npm scripts has a "feature" where it automatically runs scripts with the name <em>prexxx</em> where <em>xxx</em> is the name of another script. In essence, npm and husky will run <code>"precommit"</code> scripts twice if you name the script <code>"commit"</code>, and the workaround is to prevent the npm-triggered <em>precommit</em> script.</p></blockquote><p>That is all :) . I will do a special mention to <a href="https://commitlint.js.org/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commitlint</a> that is a very useful tool to lint commit messages. I do not use it anymore as it has some overlap with commitizen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[PRs should only be part of certain environments and not a general practice]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few years, some practices appear to be more a dogma than a value adding practice. One of this is <code>Pull Requests</code>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-prs-exist">Why PR's exist<a class="hash-link" href="#why-prs-exist" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Malicious Code Prevention</strong>: Pull requests exist mostly as a practice accepted for <code>zero trust environments</code> (ex. Open Source). An attack vector on this type of environment is the ability of anyone to contribute, meaning you could inject code that could create known vulnerabilities that packages will inherit. That is why maintainers validate code from unknown users.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/alvarolorentedev/diagrams/blob/main/Stop%20doing%20PR.drawio.png?raw=true" alt="Malicious actors" class="img_ev3q"></p><ul><li><strong>Highly Distributed Teams</strong>: PR's can be use for highly distributed teams (around the clock) as a way to do knowledge sharing. If someone in side A of the world can follow and understand the changes for a feature that is being developed in side B of the world.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/alvarolorentedev/diagrams/blob/main/Stop%20doing%20PR-Around%20The%20Clock.drawio.png?raw=true" alt="Distributed Teams" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-issue">The issue<a class="hash-link" href="#the-issue" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>IS there any value of doing PRs when people work collocated? What is the cost of PRs in trust environments?</p><p>The value that normally people give to PRs is the one of having a <strong>peer review process</strong>. Nevertheless, we will see later in this article that there are less invasive ways to do this.</p><p>Some costs of PRs are:</p><ul><li><strong>Slow Delivery</strong>: PRs are a start and stop strategy where there is a gateway to merge code. This is time that needs to be taken by developers (writting &amp; preparing a PR) and reviewers (reviewing, commenting, etc) to go through the process. At the same time is more time the code takes to get to production (merging, re-testing, etc). This is significant for features but also for fixes, meaning you can go from a response time of minutes to hours.</li><li><strong>Isolation work</strong>: When working on branches, devs work on code that works isolated but needs to be merged with a continuous stream of changes. This means that any test isolated will probably be invalidated upon merging.</li><li><strong>Lack of ownership</strong>: As work is done isolated, the developer who creates a PR delegates part or the responsibility to the reviewer. Humans don't have compilers or containers to run the code in our brain, meaning catching errors tends to be out of our realm.</li><li><strong>Egos</strong>: As catching errors tends to be out of our human realm, PRs tend to become a thing related to preferences (Style, patterns, etc). This hardly provides any value to the code as either tools like linters can do this automatically or it brings premature optimizations.</li><li><strong>Late feedback</strong>: Any valid recommendation is actually provided quite late in the process, when the code has already been written and validated. Causing rework that takes time.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-alternatives">The Alternatives<a class="hash-link" href="#the-alternatives" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><code>Pull requests</code> are just one of the asynchronous peer code reviews styles. Is not the only way of doing peer reviews.</p><p>Some other types of peer reviews that I, personally, like are:</p><ul><li><strong>Over-the-shoulder</strong>: The bases of this is to have a conversation over what has been or is being implemented. This creates a synchronous feedback loop on an async process. It does not fix all the shortcomings of a PR, but it creates a faster feedback loop.</li><li><strong>Pair Programming / Mob Programming</strong>: The idea is that multiple developers work in the same code base in the same computer, creating a synchronous feedback loop in a synchronous process. This with <code>Trunk-based development</code> allows very fast feedback loops at product level, and with the correct tools generates resilience and ownership among developers.</li></ul><p>The disclaimer here is I have worked doing pair programming, TDD and trunk-based development for more than 5 years in multiple size companies, and it has always been a bliss.</p>]]></content:encoded>
