  Break Out Of The Comfort Zone: The Need for Big Leaps Over Incremental
  Improvements

From a young age, we're taught the value of steady, incremental progress. The idea is that like a determined tortoise, we can reach our goals by moving deliberately in the right direction. But could there be a more efficient approach?


## The Comfort Zone a Default State


It's widely recognized that individuals typically operate within their comfort zones. But what exactly is the comfort zone? Here's a potential definition:


> The comfort zone refers to a psychological state in which one feels familiar, safe, and at ease. It is the area of experience where a person operates in an anxiety-neutral condition, using a limited set of behaviors to deliver a steady level of performance, usually without any sense of risk or need for change.


Sticking to what's familiar can often deter us from making significant strides in improving our lives. More often than not, we choose minor, incremental changes that don't veer too far from our routine.


This fondness for comfort zones isn't just personalâ€”it extends into software development practices and product development too. Frequently, teams would rather make minor adjustments than take the risk of adopting an entirely new approach. This could be due to fear of failure, resistance to change, or simply not being aware of the potential benefits of a different approach.


Sure, these incremental changes are easier to manage and implement. They cause less disruption to our current systems and processes, letting us maintain stability and make small steps forward. But, they can also restrict our potential for innovation and growth. When we only focus on baby steps, we might overlook the chance to make a big leap that could bring about significant benefits.


This leads us to ask: Are these small improvements enough? Do they truly meet the needs of the team and the organization, or are they simply a safe and comfortable route that leads to average results?


## Signs of Need For change


Let's consider some signs that may indicate the presence of comfort zones:

- **Stalled Progress**: If we see little to no significant progress over a lengthy period, it could mean our team might be tweaking things without making a real impact. In this case, the next level of improvement could be further than anticipated.
- **Reluctance towards new ideas**: A quick dismissal or resistance to new suggestions can indicate a deep-rooted reluctance to change. This resistance is often due to the comfort of the familiar, fear of the unknown, and potential risks associated with change.
- **Unchanging strategies**: If we find ourselves continually resorting to the same solutions or minor variations of past strategies, it suggests that we're stuck in a comfort zone. A hesitation to try new approaches, especially when facing repetitive challenges, signals a comfort zone.

Therefore, it's crucial to continually assess your team's adaptability. If there are signs of stagnation, resistance to change, or a lack of creative problem-solving, it may be time to challenge the comfort zone and think about making more substantial changes instead of small, incremental ones.


If you are already measuring the behavior, you will notice comfort zones can be represented as logarithmic functions.

## Implementing Change


Recognizing the need for change is just the beginning. Here's how we can pave the way forward:

1. **Spot key metrics**: Initiate by spotting key metrics that accurately represent the area you're aiming to enhance. These metrics should be specific, measurable, and directly tied to the performance or behavior you're looking to improve.
2. **Gauge the current situation**: Use these as a benchmark to contrast your future performance and evaluate the progress of your initiative.
3. **Set a North Star**: Set a clear, ambitious yet attainable goal that will steer your efforts. This goal should push your team to step out of their comfort zone, but still be within reach. Ensure this goal is in line with your wider business objectives and resonates with your team members, providing them a strong incentive to aim for the initiative.
4. **Estimate the gap**: Evaluate the difference between your current performance and your North Star. This is the distance your team needs to traverse to achieve the desired improvement. Understanding this gap will give you a clear sense of the scope of the change required and will help shape your strategy for the initiative.
5. **Plan the change**: Having defined your key metrics and North Star, begin plotting the course required for the initiative. You will be faced with 2 options:
	1. **Bold Move**: Occasionally, a significant departure from the current state to your ultimate goal is necessary. Always consider this as your primary option.
	2. **Gradual Progress**: If the change appears overwhelming or too abrupt, reduce it by taking smaller steps towards your ultimate goal.
6. **Review and Refine**: Continually track your progress and compare it to your initial benchmark. Use this information to fine-tune your approach, adjust your strategy, and implement necessary modifications.

## Final Thoughts


It's crucial to remember that change is not always easy, but it's often necessary for growth. Incremental improvements have their place, but occasionally, we need to take confident leaps to truly innovate and realize our full potential. By willing to step outside our comfort zones, we open ourselves up to new possibilities and opportunities for improvement. Next time you're with your team, ponder over these topics. It's vital to identify your guiding star to reach it. 
For example, consider this in the context of your team's productivity. What practices could make you the most efficient team? For me, the answer was Extreme Programming (XP). You might contemplate a significant shift from individual development with pull requests to mob programming, and smaller steps towards adopting Trunk-Based Development due to the need for additional tools.


Also, don't hesitate to think creatively about product development. For instance, we often have to shift Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to meet Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), like increasing the lead conversion percentage. If the leap percentage is high, you might need to implement revolutionary new strategies, rather than sticking with the status quo.
