title: 'Mastering Second Level Relationships: A Key Strategy for Workplace Success'
---

Workplaces operate as complex social ecosystems, with dynamics that reach beyond our immediate coworkers and supervisors to include a broader network of relationships. These secondary connections, which are frequently underestimated, are vital to personal success and the overall effectiveness of an organization.


Have you ever thought about how to manage these second level relationships? This post aims to delve into the concept of second level relations at work and their significance.


## Understanding Second Level Relationships


Second level relations in a work context refers to connections with individuals or groups outside your immediate team, who nonetheless can dramatically impact your work. This includes stakeholders, teams from other departments, service providers, and clients. Much like distant relatives in a family, you may not interact with them daily, but their influence on the work environment can be significant.


These second level relations have a substantial impact on productivity. For example, a good rapport with a key stakeholder could mean faster approvals and quicker project completion. Similarly, positive relations with other teams can foster cross-departmental collaboration, creating a more cohesive and efficient work environment. Conversely, negative relationships could cause problems. That's why it's essential to proactively manage these relationships.


Now, let's categorize and delve into these relationships.


### **Stakeholders**


 A stakeholder can be an individual, group, or organization that has an interest in, or can be affected by, the outcomes of a project or business activity. This can include other employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders who have a stake in the project or organization's success.
Stakeholders can significantly influence the direction and success of our projects, as they are the promoters of the needs that we are trying to solve. Maintaining open communication, understanding their needs and expectations, and addressing their concerns proactively can foster a positive and productive relationship. 


### **Other Teams** 


These are groups within the same organization but working on different projects or tasks. They may have different goals and objectives, but their actions and decisions can significantly influence the progress of our projects. 


Healthy relationships with other teams can facilitate better resource sharing, problem-solving, and collaboration. Miscommunication or disputes with other teams can hinder progress, cause delays and create a challenging work environment. Thus, it's essential to maintain clear communication and mutual respect with other teams.


### **Providers**


These are the external organizations or individuals who supply goods, services, or expertise that are essential to our projects. This can include everything from software vendors, consulting firms, to freelance experts. Providers can have a significant impact on our project timelines, budgets, and overall success. 


If a provider fails to deliver as expected, it can cause delays, increase costs, or even jeopardize the entire project. On the flip side, a reliable provider who understands our needs and reliably meets their commitments can be a key factor in a project's success. Therefore, maintaining good relationships with providers is crucial. This involves clear communication, timely payments, and treating them as partners in our success.


### **Clients/Customers**


These are the end-users of the product or service we are developing. They can greatly influence our projects, as their feedback and satisfaction often determine the project's direction and success. 


Understanding their needs, addressing their concerns quickly, and valuing their feedback are essential for a positive relationship. A satisfied client can lead to repeat business, positive word-of-mouth, and improved reputation, while an unsatisfied client can hinder the project's success.


## Determining Importance of relationships


In assessing the value of relationships, it's key to look at aspects like how often you interact, how interconnected your work is, and their sway in decision-making. By ranking relationships with these factors in mind, you can direct your energies where they'll have the most impact - after all, we can't cultivate every relationship equally.


I typically use Stakeholder Mapping to gauge influence and examine the state of a relationship. You'll find a template in the following image and this [link](https://excalidraw.com/#json=7qSzy52drnbwd6Sy8C2dz,bEm6jClB_RWoI3a6YV5QRg).

To map out the relationships that impact your project, follow these steps:

- **Identify Relationships**: Make a list of all the 2nd level relationships that have an impact on your project.
For example, while the CEO may be a key figure in the company, if they are not directly involved in your project, including them on your map may only complicate things.

- **Assess Influence**: Position these relationships on the influence axis according to how much they affect your project, relative to each other.
For example, while the CEO might hold a lot of sway in the company, if they don't affect your project, their influence on you is limited.

- **Define Relationship Status**: Determine whether they are supporting your efforts (Supporters) or hindering your progress (Detractors), relative to each other.
For instance, if your main stakeholder is continuously expressing dissatisfaction and losing faith in the project and team, they would be considered a Detractor.

- **Revisit and Reevaluate Regularly**: Relationships can change over time. It's important to frequently reassess the status and influence of your second-level relationships and modify your strategies as needed.

## Improving Relationships


 


When relationships that require enhancement have been pinpointed, a variety of specific strategies can be implemented to foster growth and improvement in these areas:

- **Empathize**: It is crucial to not only understand but also empathize with the concerns, anxieties, and reservations that the other party may have. This involves putting yourself in their shoes and viewing situations from their perspective, which can go a long way in building mutual understanding and respect.
- **Be proactive**: Rather than waiting for the other party to take action or initiate improvements, it's beneficial to take the first step. This proactive approach shows your commitment to the relationship and can inspire the other party to reciprocate your efforts.
- **Improve Communication**: Quite often, the root cause of relationship issues is miscommunication or a complete lack of communication. It's essential to understand the communication needs of the other party and act upon them. This could involve being more open, transparent, or timely with your communication, or perhaps adjusting your communication style to better match theirs.
- **Build the connections**: Beyond the professional capacity, take the time to get to know the person behind the role. Keep in mind that not all factors that motivate a person are work-related. By sharing personal experiences and being open to finding common ground and understanding, you may discover shared interests or values that can strengthen your working relationship. Better interpersonal relationships can contribute to a more cohesive and productive working environment.
