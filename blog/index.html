It also leads to inefficiencies as it focuses on the reactiveness to the needs of the teams &amp; company and not a proactive approach towards the same long-term needs due to the lack of common vision. It also has the drawback that enforces the dev vs ops culture and not a DevOps culture that has shown over and over again the positive effect on quality and speed of delivery of stream-aligned teams.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="devops-or-dev-vs-ops">’DevOps’ or ‘Dev vs Ops’<a href="#devops-or-dev-vs-ops" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ’DevOps’ or ‘Dev vs Ops’" title="Direct link to ’DevOps’ or ‘Dev vs Ops’">​</a></h2>
<p>Traditionally, Dev and Ops teams have operated in silos, each with their own distinct goals and priorities.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Focus</th><th><strong>Priorities</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Dev Culture</strong></td><td>Development teams are primarily focused on creating new features, writing code, and ensuring the software meets user requirements.</td><td>Speed and innovation</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ops Culture</strong></td><td>Operations teams are responsible for maintaining the stability, security, and performance of the software in production environments.</td><td>Reliability and uptime</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>This separation can lead to several challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communication Barriers:</strong> Lack of communication between Dev and Ops can result in misunderstandings and delays. Developers may not fully understand the operational constraints, while Ops may struggle with the rapid pace of development.</li>
<li><strong>Conflicting Goals:</strong> Developers prioritize speed and innovation, while Ops prioritize stability and reliability. These conflicting goals can create friction and hinder collaboration.</li>
<li><strong>Inefficiencies:</strong> Siloed teams often duplicate efforts and use different tools, leading to inefficiencies and wasted resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal of DevOps is to create a culture of ownership to stream aligned teams to do development and operations, breaking down traditional silos and fostering a more integrated approach to software delivery. While the existing operations teams become a provider of abstractions that simplifies that work, reducing the cognitive load of operating the system.</p>
<p>This brings the next benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced Collaboration:</strong> Breaking down silos fosters a culture of collaboration, enabling teams to work together more effectively and share knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Efficiency:</strong> Streamlined workflows and standardized tools reduce redundancy and improve operational efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Greater Innovation:</strong> A unified approach allows teams to quickly adapt to new technologies and methodologies, driving innovation and continuous improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Customer-Centric Approach:</strong> By aligning development and operations goals, teams can better understand and meet the needs of end-users, resulting in higher customer satisfaction.</li>

<p>A platform team acts as a service provider for all internal stream-aligned teams, offering essential tools, infrastructure, and support to streamline their work and enhance productivity. We could start enumerating systems and solutions that a platform team can own. But the reality is that would be the same as creating a product without doing any research on your clients.</p>
<p>To truly drive value within an organization, a platform team must deeply understand and address the needs of stream-aligned teams. These teams are directly responsible for delivering products and services to customers, and their success hinges on the support and resources provided by the platform team. Here’s how a platform team can effectively drive value by focusing on the needs of stream-aligned teams:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active Engagement and Communication:</strong> work collaboratively with stream-aligned teams to develop solutions that address their specific pain points, fostering a sense of shared responsibility and mutual support.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Improvement and Innovation:</strong> Implement iterative development practices to continuously refine and improve tools and services.</li>
<li><strong>Metrics and Performance Tracking:</strong> Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of the platform team’s support and use data-driven approaches to make informed decisions about resource allocation and process improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Empowerment and Autonomy:</strong> Develop self-service platforms that empower stream-aligned teams to manage their own resources and workflows, and provide comprehensive training and support to ensure proficiency in using the tools and services offered by the platform team.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The key benefits this strategy tries to achieve are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> By centralizing infrastructure management, tooling, and support, the platform team reduces redundancy and improves operational efficiency. Stream-aligned teams can focus on delivering value to customers without worrying about underlying infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Standardized tools and processes ensure consistency across the organization, making it easier to manage and scale applications.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability:</strong> A dedicated platform team ensures that the infrastructure is reliable and secure, minimizing downtime and enhancing the overall stability of applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>By fostering a culture of ownership and collaboration, and by providing abstractions that simplify operations, the platform team can significantly reduce the cognitive load on stream-aligned teams. This transformation brings enhanced collaboration, improved efficiency, greater innovation, and a customer-centric approach, ultimately driving the success of the organization.</p>
<p>As we continue to evolve, the key to driving value lies in deeply understanding and addressing the needs of stream-aligned teams. Through active engagement, continuous improvement, metrics tracking, and empowerment, the platform team can ensure that stream-aligned teams are equipped to deliver exceptional products and services to our customers. This strategy not only centralizes infrastructure management and standardizes tools but also ensures reliability and consistency across the organization, paving the way for sustained growth and success.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/2025/04/28/T06:00:00.000Z-The Role of Transparency in Leadership: How You can Build Trust and Healthy Chains of Command">The Role of Transparency in Leadership: How You can Build Trust and Healthy Chains of Command</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2025-04-28T00:00:00.000Z">April 28, 2025</time> · <!-- -->6 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/alvarolorentedev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3071208" alt="Alvaro Jose"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/alvarolorentedev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp">Alvaro Jose</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Fractional CTO &amp; Founder">Fractional CTO &amp; Founder</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has spent years navigating the complexities of engineering leadership, I can tell you that transparency is one of the most critical elements of effective leadership.

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-transparency-matters"><strong>Why Transparency Matters</strong><a href="#why-transparency-matters" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to why-transparency-matters" title="Direct link to why-transparency-matters">​</a></h2>
<p>Transparency in leadership is about being open, honest, and straightforward with your team. It involves sharing information, explaining decisions, and being clear about expectations and goals. This openness builds trust, fosters a culture of accountability, and encourages open communication.</p>
<p>When leaders are transparent, they create an environment where team members feel valued and respected. They know that their leaders are not hiding anything from them and that they can rely on the information provided. This helps to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Building Trust and Credibility:</strong> Trust is not something that can be demanded; it must be earned. By being transparent, you demonstrate integrity and honesty, which are crucial for building credibility.</li>
<li><strong>Encouraging Open Communication:</strong> When team members see that their leaders are open and honest, they are more likely to reciprocate. This creates a culture where everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas, concerns, and feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Fostering Accountability:</strong> When you are open about your own performance and hold yourself accountable for your actions, you encourage your team to do the same. This culture of accountability leads to higher performance and continuous improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Enhancing Employee Morale and Engagement:</strong> Employees who work in a transparent environment are generally more satisfied and engaged. They appreciate knowing that their leaders are honest and forthcoming, which creates a sense of security and belonging. When employees feel informed and included in the decision-making process, they are more likely to be committed to the organization&#x27;s mission and values.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transparency-in-a-healthy-chain-of-command"><strong>Transparency in a Healthy Chain of Command</strong><a href="#transparency-in-a-healthy-chain-of-command" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to transparency-in-a-healthy-chain-of-command" title="Direct link to transparency-in-a-healthy-chain-of-command">​</a></h2>
<p>A healthy chain of command relies heavily on transparency. In a transparent organization, information flows freely up and down the hierarchy. Leaders at all levels are open about their decisions, goals, and challenges, which ensures that everyone is aligned and working towards the same objectives.</p>
<p>When transparency is lacking, it can lead to misunderstandings, mistrust, and a breakdown in communication. Team members may feel left out of the loop, leading to disengagement and decreased morale. On the other hand, a transparent chain of command fosters a sense of unity and collaboration, as everyone is aware of their roles and how they contribute to the organization&#x27;s success.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-importance-of-avoiding-secrecy-in-strategic-decisions"><strong>The Importance of Avoiding Secrecy in Strategic Decisions</strong><a href="#the-importance-of-avoiding-secrecy-in-strategic-decisions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-importance-of-avoiding-secrecy-in-strategic-decisions" title="Direct link to the-importance-of-avoiding-secrecy-in-strategic-decisions">​</a></h2>
<p>While there are instances where strategic secrecy is necessary, it&#x27;s equally important to recognize the potential downsides of keeping strategic decisions hidden from your team. Transparency in strategic decision-making can significantly enhance trust, engagement, and overall organizational performance.</p>

<p>Here’s why avoiding secrecy in strategic decisions is crucial:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhancing Trust and Engagement:</strong> When leaders are transparent about strategic decisions, it builds trust within the team. Employees feel valued and respected when they are kept in the loop about the direction of the organization. This trust fosters a sense of ownership and commitment, leading to higher levels of engagement and motivation. Research has shown that organizations with high levels of trust and transparency tend to have more engaged employees, which directly correlates with improved performance and lower turnover rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improving Decision Quality:</strong> Transparency in strategic decision-making encourages diverse perspectives and input from various levels of the organization. When employees are aware of the strategic direction and the reasons behind it, they can provide valuable insights and feedback that might not have been considered otherwise. This collaborative approach leads to more informed and well-rounded decisions, ultimately benefiting the organization.</p>
<p>For example, a study by Harvard Business Review found that companies that involve employees in strategic planning processes are more likely to achieve their goals and adapt to changes effectively. By avoiding secrecy, leaders can tap into the collective intelligence of their team, leading to better outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Preventing Misinformation and Rumors:</strong> Secrecy can often lead to misinformation and rumors, which can be detrimental to organizational morale and cohesion. When employees are left in the dark, they may speculate and create their own narratives, which can lead to confusion and mistrust. By being transparent about strategic decisions, leaders can ensure that accurate information is disseminated, reducing the likelihood of rumors and fostering a more cohesive and informed team.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, transparency is a cornerstone of effective leadership and a healthy chain of command. By being open and honest, leaders can build trust, encourage open communication, foster accountability, enhance employee morale, and drive organizational success. As you aspire to take on leadership roles, remember that transparency is not just a strategy; it&#x27;s a commitment to creating a positive and thriving workplace culture.</p>
<p>Embrace transparency, and you&#x27;ll be well on your way to becoming a trusted and effective leader.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/2024/09/26/T22:00:00.000Z-Job Trial Period: A Two Way Street For Success">Job Trial Period: A Two Way Street For Success</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-09-26T00:00:00.000Z">September 26, 2024</time> · <!-- -->6 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/alvarolorentedev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3071208" alt="Alvaro Jose"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/alvarolorentedev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp">Alvaro Jose</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Fractional CTO &amp; Founder">Fractional CTO &amp; Founder</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Dear readers, I am back. I apologize for the hiatus, it has been a few “interesting” months in my life that have made me reflect a lot on some topics that before I thought were trivial, and one-sided. I will try to share some thoughts over the next few posts. So let&#x27;s start with a subject that is really fresh in my mind, as it&#x27;s what has been affecting me over the last few months.</p>
<p>To the question “During your career, did to pass a Job trial period?” the most common answer will be “Yes”. Traditionally, it is viewed as a tool for employers to evaluate potential hires, nevertheless it&#x27;s crucial to recognize that these periods serve a dual purpose. They are, in fact, a two-way street that benefits both employers and employees alike.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-in-for-us">What is in for Us?<a href="#what-is-in-for-us" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is in for Us?" title="Direct link to What is in for Us?">​</a></h2>
<p>The trial period is an evaluation period, it can even be seen as an extension of the interview process, as you will never get to know a person you will spend most of your awake workday day with.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the same as in interview, we need to remember is not a one-sided evaluation, Employers should evaluate ROI &amp; employees should evaluate company fitness.</p>
<p>From an <strong>employer&#x27;s standpoint</strong>, trial periods offer several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skill Assessment:</strong> Employers can evaluate a candidate&#x27;s practical skills and how they apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural Fit:</strong> It provides an opportunity to assess how well the new hire integrates with the existing team and company culture.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Evaluation:</strong> Employers can gauge the employee&#x27;s productivity, work ethic, and ability to meet deadlines.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Mitigation:</strong> If the employee doesn&#x27;t meet expectations, the company can part ways with minimal legal and financial implications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Equally important, but often overlooked, is the <strong>employee&#x27;s perspective</strong> on trial periods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Company Culture Experience:</strong> Employees can immerse themselves in the company culture and determine if it aligns with their values and work style.</li>
<li><strong>Job Satisfaction Assessment:</strong> It allows individuals to evaluate if the role meets their expectations and career aspirations.</li>
<li><strong>Team Dynamics:</strong> Employees can assess how well they work with their colleagues and immediate supervisors.</li>
<li><strong>Work-Life Balance:</strong> The trial period offers insight into the company&#x27;s approach to work-life balance and flexibility</li>
</ul>

<p>To make the most of a job trial period, both parties should approach it with openness and clear communication:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set Clear Expectations:</strong> Employers should outline specific goals and performance metrics for the trial period.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Feedback:</strong> Implement a system for frequent, two-way feedback to address concerns and acknowledge progress.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage Questions:</strong> Create an environment where the new hire feels comfortable asking questions and seeking clarification.</li>
<li><strong>Provide Necessary Resources:</strong> Ensure the employee has all the tools and information needed to perform their job effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve this, we need to use the correct tools for the job</p>

<p>An effective onboarding plan should contain:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comprehensive introduction:</strong> Include an overview of the company&#x27;s culture, policies, and procedures.</li>
<li><strong>Role-specific training:</strong> Provide training tailored to the new employee&#x27;s specific job responsibilities.</li>
<li><strong>Introduction to team and colleagues:</strong> Facilitate meetings with team members and key personnel.</li>
<li><strong>Resource provision:</strong> Ensure the employee has all necessary tools and information to perform their job effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Assign a buddy</strong>: pair the employee with a more experienced colleague who can provide informal guidance and support that can help navigate the day-to-day aspects of the job.</li>
<li><strong>Assign a mentor</strong>: pair the employee mentor is usually a more senior employee who can provide guidance, share industry insights, and help them grow in their role over a longer period.</li>
<li><strong>Regular feedback sessions:</strong> as a manager, schedule frequent check-ins to address concerns and acknowledge progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>A well-structured onboarding plan helps new employees quickly integrate into their roles and the organization, reducing the learning curve and increasing productivity during the trial period.</p>

<p>A 30-60-90 plan is a strategic framework used for onboarding new employees or setting goals for the first 90 days in a new role. It breaks down objectives and expectations into three distinct periods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>30 days:</strong> Focus on learning and understanding the role, company culture, and immediate responsibilities.</li>
<li><strong>60 days:</strong> Begin contributing more actively, implementing initial strategies, and identifying areas for improvement.</li>
<li><strong>90 days:</strong> Fully integrate into the role, start driving results, and propose long-term strategies or improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>This plan helps structure the transition period, ensuring clear expectations and measurable progress for both the employee and the employer during the trial period, with a framework that can help focus the feedback and</p>

<p>When a trial period results in a successful outcome, it&#x27;s important to celebrate this achievement. Both the employer and employee should acknowledge the positive experience and use it as a foundation for future growth.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity to set new goals, discuss career development plans, and reinforce the mutual commitment to success. A successful trial period can lead to increased motivation, job satisfaction, and a stronger sense of belonging within the organization.</p>

<p>If an employer decides not to continue the employment relationship after the trial period, it&#x27;s crucial to handle the situation professionally and sensitively.</p>
<p>The employer should provide clear, constructive feedback about why the trial was unsuccessful, focusing on the root cause without personal criticisms. This feedback can be valuable for the employee&#x27;s future career development.</p>
<p>Additionally, the employer should ensure all legal and contractual obligations are met, including any notice periods or severance pay if applicable. Treating the departing employee with respect and dignity during this process is not only ethical, but also maintains the company&#x27;s reputation as a fair employer.</p>

<p>When an employee decides not to continue after the trial period, it&#x27;s equally important to handle the situation professionally.</p>
<p>The employee should provide honest feedback about their experience, highlighting any misalignment or concerns that led to their decision. This feedback can be valuable for the employer to improve their onboarding process or workplace environment.</p>
<p>The employee should also ensure they fulfill any contractual obligations, such as providing proper notice.</p>

<p>Job trial periods are an opportunity for both parties to evaluate the potential for a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship. By approaching these periods with transparency, open communication, and a willingness to learn, both employers and employees can make informed decisions about their future together.</p>
<p>This period should not be demonized, even if it ends in a “No Pass”, it should be taken as a good outcome as it&#x27;s a relationship that would have most probably failed, or would create friction and other risks down the road when legal obligation from both sides are more complex.
If you&#x27;re the employee, remember this is not a failure. Your worth remains unchanged—it simply wasn&#x27;t the right fit or timing. If you&#x27;re the employer, don&#x27;t be too hard on yourself. Not all relationships work out. The best approach is to move forward and end things on the best terms possible.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/2024/07/31/T22:00:00.000Z-Rethinking Technical Tasks: Define any task as user value">Rethinking Technical Tasks: Define any task as user value</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-07-31T00:00:00.000Z">July 31, 2024</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/alvarolorentedev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3071208" alt="Alvaro Jose"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/alvarolorentedev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp">Alvaro Jose</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Fractional CTO &amp; Founder">Fractional CTO &amp; Founder</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever considered the various types of tasks within a team? Why do we often separate tasks into &#x27;technical&#x27; and &#x27;product&#x27; categories? Is this division a reality, or is it simply a reflection of our difficulty in articulating the value of non-functional behavior?</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-current-concept-of-technical-task">The Current Concept of Technical Task<a href="#the-current-concept-of-technical-task" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Current Concept of Technical Task" title="Direct link to The Current Concept of Technical Task">​</a></h2>
<p>Technical tasks are typically considered those that involve the underlying work on non-functional related endeavors. These can include activities like updating dependencies, improving performance, etc.
While they may not always have a direct visible impact on the end user, In reality, almost every task a development team undertakes has some level of impact on the product. Even tasks perceived as purely technical, such as improving code quality or optimizing performance, ultimately contribute to a better user experience and product reliability.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="understanding-the-net-value-of-tasks">Understanding the Net Value of Tasks<a href="#understanding-the-net-value-of-tasks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Understanding the Net Value of Tasks" title="Direct link to Understanding the Net Value of Tasks">​</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Any team effort needs to have a clear purpose, whether it&#x27;s technical or product-related.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IIf we approach our work with the previous quote in mind, any endeavor a team undertakes should yield a positive return on investment. Let&#x27;s express this value as a simple formula:</p>
<p>$ = Value - Cost</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Value</strong>: The benefit or worth that a task or project brings to the organization, often measured in terms of revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>: The amount of resources, including time, money, and effort, required to complete a task or project.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#x27;s normally simpler to calculate the expected value of functional tasks because their impact on user experience and business metrics is more direct and measurable. However, even technical tasks, when evaluated through this lens, can reveal significant contributions to the product&#x27;s overall value.</p>
<p>The benefit we will achieve from this approach is a more cohesive and efficient development process, where all tasks are recognized for their contribution to the product&#x27;s success. This integrated approach to task management allows for more strategic prioritization. When all tasks are evaluated based on their potential impact on the product, teams can make more informed decisions about where to allocate their resources. This can result in more timely delivery of features and improvements, better risk management, and a more adaptable development process.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="functional-task-adding-a-new-feature">Functional Task: Adding a New Feature<a href="#functional-task-adding-a-new-feature" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Functional Task: Adding a New Feature" title="Direct link to Functional Task: Adding a New Feature">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>Task</strong>: Implement a new user login feature.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Value</strong>: This feature is expected to increase user sign-ups by 5%, leading to an estimated increase in revenue of $5,000 per month.</li>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>: The development team estimates that it will take a week to complete this task (around 40 hours). Assuming an average hourly rate of $50, the total cost is $2,000.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>$ Value Calculation</strong>:
$ = Value - Cost</p>
<p>$ = $5,000 - $2,000</p>
<p>$ = $3,000 per month</p>

<p><strong>Task</strong>: Optimize the application&#x27;s performance to reduce load times and enhance user experience.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Value</strong>: Faster load times are expected to improve user retention by 15%, leading to an estimated increase in paid users and an additional revenue of $7,000 per month.</li>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>: The development team estimates that it will take 50 hours to complete this task. Assuming an average hourly rate of $50, the total cost is $2,500.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>$ Value Calculation</strong>:
$ = Value - Cost</p>
<p>$ = $7,000 - $2,500</p>
<p>$ = $4,500 per month</p>
<p>With these examples in mind, it makes more sense to start with performance improvements and not working on the functional task.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="embrace-a-unified-approach-to-task-management">Embrace a Unified Approach to Task Management<a href="#embrace-a-unified-approach-to-task-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Embrace a Unified Approach to Task Management" title="Direct link to Embrace a Unified Approach to Task Management">​</a></h2>
<p>To truly integrate technical and product tasks, teams should adopt a unified approach to task management. This involves recognizing that every task, no matter how technical it may seem, plays a crucial role in the overall product vision. Here are some additional strategies to ensure this integration:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Unified Backlog</strong>: Maintain a single backlog that includes both product features and technical tasks. This ensures that all tasks are visible to the entire team and can be prioritized based on their overall impact on the product.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-functional Teams</strong>: Foster cross-functional teams where developers, product managers, and other stakeholders work closely together. This can help bridge the gap between technical and product perspectives, leading to more informed decision-making.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Reviews</strong>: Conduct regular reviews of the backlog and ongoing tasks to ensure that technical debt is being addressed, and that product features are aligned with technical improvements.</li>
</ol>

<p>In conclusion, the distinction between technical and product tasks is often more conceptual than practical. By recognizing the interdependence of these tasks and integrating them into a unified development process, teams can enhance both product quality and development efficiency. It&#x27;s time to stop segregating tasks and start viewing them as integral parts of a cohesive product development strategy. This holistic approach will improve the end product and foster a more collaborative and productive team environment.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/2024/07/25/T22:00:00.000Z-Improving Mental Health at Work: Strategies for a Healthier Workplace">Improving Mental Health at Work: Strategies for a Healthier Workplace</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-07-25T00:00:00.000Z">July 25, 2024</time> · <!-- -->6 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/alvarolorentedev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3071208" alt="Alvaro Jose"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/alvarolorentedev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp">Alvaro Jose</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Fractional CTO &amp; Founder">Fractional CTO &amp; Founder</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Last week, we discussed the importance of managing 100% utilization within the team to maintain their well-being. As individuals, we each react differently to experiences, which can have long-term consequences.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that I haven&#x27;t been writing as frequently as I would like. I feel bad about this, but I was overwhelmed from overworking in multiple areas. Had this continued without any action, I might have faced significant burnout. So, let&#x27;s talk today about mental health at work.</p>

<p>Whether we&#x27;re discussing company-wide methodologies like OKRs or team-specific practices like pair programming, it&#x27;s common to see implementations fall short. Often, methodologies bear the brunt of the blame due to misalignment.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s delve into the reasons behind these failures, and assess whether the methodology itself is at fault.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Difficulty in Tracking Results</strong>: When new methods are introduced, it&#x27;s often challenging to see immediate results or advantages. This can lead to premature rejection of the new approach.</li>
<li><strong>Insufficient Engagement</strong>: This covers situations where members aren&#x27;t entirely on board with the new process. This could stem from inadequate understanding, disagreement with the methodology, or simple resistance to change.</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are other reasons for failure, they typically fall under or relate closely to these main points.</p>

<p>To foster patience within the engineering department, it&#x27;s essential that the company culture not only values it, but actively encourages it. Here&#x27;s how:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Celebrate Patience</strong>: Recognize and reward patience in your workspace. This could involve acknowledging those who demonstrate patience when faced with challenges, or associating rewards and promotions with the successful long-term execution of changes.</li>
<li><strong>Highlight the Role of Patience</strong>: Keep reminding your people about the crucial role patience plays in long-term success. Share anecdotes or instances where patience has proven beneficial in the past.</li>
<li><strong>Lead by Example</strong>: Leadership should portray patience in their actions and decision-making. This means resisting the urge to follow the latest trends without adequate evaluation, and allowing new processes sufficient time to integrate and yield results.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some individuals are eager to tackle new challenges and progress rapidly, while others prefer maintaining the status quo. Do you find one approach more valuable than the other, and if so, why?</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from the book Radical Candor, this article will discuss the categorization of engineers into Superstars and Rockstars. We&#x27;ll examine their unique traits, contributions, and roles within the development process.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="superstar-engineers">Superstar Engineers<a href="#superstar-engineers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Superstar Engineers" title="Direct link to Superstar Engineers">​</a></h2>
<p>Superstar Engineers are those who strive for more than just the ordinary, who are ready to take calculated risks for innovation. Within the technology sector, they act as catalysts for change and disruption.</p>
<p>Some traits you can find in the work of these engineers:</p>
<ul>
<li>They continuously pursue growth and development</li>
<li>They’re not content with the status quo</li>
<li>They’re willing to take risks to innovate</li>
<li>They’re frequently the driving force behind breakthroughs  in technologies, processes, practices, or products</li>
<li>They’re motivated by a passion for innovation and growth</li>
<li>They propel the team forward, ensuring it stays relevant and competitive</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rockstar-engineers">Rockstar Engineers<a href="#rockstar-engineers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Rockstar Engineers" title="Direct link to Rockstar Engineers">​</a></h2>
<p>Rockstar Engineers are the backbone of the team, providing the dependability that keeps everything running smoothly. Without their steady influence, the boundary-pushing work of Superstars would be far less effective.</p>
<p>Some traits you can find in the work of these engineers:</p>
<ul>
<li>They provide stability and consistency within the team.</li>
<li>They&#x27;re domain experts, with a deep understanding of particular systems or processes</li>
<li>They ensure the smooth running of systems and processes</li>
<li>They manage and enhance existing systems</li>
<li>They&#x27;re highly reliable, often serving as the go-to person for issues within their domain</li>
<li>They&#x27;re incredibly dependable, often the first person you&#x27;d call for problems in their area</li>
<li>They value quality and take genuine pride in their work</li>
<li>While they may not be the most visible, their contribution to the team and the business is absolutely critical</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="types-of-engineers-and-engineering-strategy">Types of Engineers and engineering strategy<a href="#types-of-engineers-and-engineering-strategy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Types of Engineers and engineering strategy" title="Direct link to Types of Engineers and engineering strategy">​</a></h2>
<p>Having discussed different types of engineers, let&#x27;s now explore how this impacts various aspects of our company or team.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team--company-composition">Team &amp; Company Composition<a href="#team--company-composition" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team &amp; Company Composition" title="Direct link to Team &amp; Company Composition">​</a></h3>
<p>It&#x27;s crucial to strike a balance between these two types of engineers inside a team or company. The optimal engineering strategy blends Superstars and Rockstars, ensuring the team has both the stability to manage current tasks and the innovative spirit required to stay competitive.</p>
<p>An overabundance of Superstars may lead to instability due to frequent changes, causing the team to remain in a perpetual state of upheaval.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an excess of Rockstars might lead to stagnation, preventing the team from adapting to necessary changes and reducing productivity.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="remuneration--growth">Remuneration &amp; Growth<a href="#remuneration--growth" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Remuneration &amp; Growth" title="Direct link to Remuneration &amp; Growth">​</a></h3>
<p>Equally important than having the correct profiles is ensuring that both are valued equally.</p>
<p>This is often a challenge as engineering ladders tend to favor Superstars, who are generally more motivated to climb the ladder.
These ladders often dictate an employee&#x27;s financial compensation. Leading to Superstars accelerating their remuneration faster than Rockstars, who may hit a pay ceiling.
For this, it&#x27;s important to tie compensation not to a specific role, but to the unique value an individual contributes to the company or team.</p>

<p>Recognizing this duality and managing it effectively is one of the key roles of leadership in the tech industry. By acknowledging and valuing the unique contributions of both Superstars and Rockstars, leaders can foster a diverse, balanced, and highly productive team. This duality is not a hindrance, but a strength that can be harnessed to drive a team or company&#x27;s success.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/2024/06/07/T00:00:00.000Z-Key Strategies for Building High-Performance Teams in Tech">Key Strategies for Building High-Performance Teams in Tech</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-06-07T00:00:00.000Z">June 7, 2024</time> · <!-- -->9 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/alvarolorentedev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3071208" alt="Alvaro Jose"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/alvarolorentedev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp">Alvaro Jose</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Fractional CTO &amp; Founder">Fractional CTO &amp; Founder</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>We all continuously hear about high-performance teams and the importance of becoming one. But there is actual no real definition of it. Is it?</p>
<ul>
<li>A team that releases many cards</li>
<li>The one that delivers high-quality code</li>
<li>The one that has all the best engineers</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer, at least for me, is none of the above.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-a-team">What is a Team?<a href="#what-is-a-team" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is a Team?" title="Direct link to What is a Team?">​</a></h2>
<p>A definition by Professor Leigh Thompson of the Kellogg School of Management:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A team is a group of people who are interdependent with respect to<br>
<!-- -->information, resources, knowledge and skills and who seek to combine<br>
<!-- -->their efforts to achieve a common goal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A group itself does not represent a team, for a group to become a team, there is a need for a common goal. As a group evolves into a team, it needs to go through several transformations.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="evolution-from-group-to-team">Evolution From Group to Team<a href="#evolution-from-group-to-team" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Evolution From Group to Team" title="Direct link to Evolution From Group to Team">​</a></h2>
<p>Teams typically go through several stages of development. These stages represent the journey from a group of strangers to a united group with common goals.</p>
<p>Tuckman&#x27;s model describes the four stages of team development as:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Forming</strong>: This is the initial stage where team members meet for the first time. Everyone is polite and positive, and there are high expectations but little understanding of the tasks ahead.</li>
<li><strong>Storming</strong>: As team members start to work together, differences of opinion may lead to conflict. This stage is marked by resistance, competition, and conflict as individual personalities emerge.</li>
<li><strong>Norming</strong>: Gradually, the team moves into the norming stage where they start to resolve their differences, appreciate colleagues&#x27; strengths, and respect the leader&#x27;s authority. The team begins to develop cohesion and unity.</li>
<li><strong>Performing</strong>: This is the stage where the team is fully functional and works towards achieving the team&#x27;s goals. There is a strong bond between team members, and everyone works collaboratively and efficiently.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the top of Performing, we could say there is o<strong>utperforming</strong> is where <strong>High-Performance</strong> teams live. This final stage is reached when the team consistently exceeds expectations and delivers exceptional results. The team is highly collaborative, innovative, and operates with a shared vision and purpose.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transitioning-from-one-team-stage-to-another">Transitioning from One Team Stage to Another<a href="#transitioning-from-one-team-stage-to-another" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Transitioning from One Team Stage to Another" title="Direct link to Transitioning from One Team Stage to Another">​</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Forming to Storming</strong>: The transition from forming to storming requires team members to start working together and engaging in discussions and decision-making. It&#x27;s important for each member to feel comfortable expressing their opinions and ideas, even if they differ from others. This phase often triggers conflicts due to diverse views, but it is a crucial part of the team&#x27;s evolution, as it allows members to understand and appreciate each other&#x27;s perspectives.</li>
<li><strong>Storming to Norming</strong>: The shift from storming to norming is marked by the resolution of conflicts and the establishment of processes and norms. This stage requires effective conflict management and open communication. Besides, the team should focus on recognizing and appreciating the strengths of each member and fostering a collaborative environment. The team begins to feel a sense of unity, and a collaborative culture starts to develop.</li>
<li><strong>Norming to Performing</strong>: Moving from norming to performing entails the team becoming more focused on achieving shared goals. The team has now established effective working relationships and understood each other&#x27;s working styles. At this stage, it&#x27;s important to stay focused on the team&#x27;s objectives and ensure everyone is working collaboratively towards them. The team becomes more autonomous, with members taking on responsibilities and roles that align with their strengths.</li>
<li><strong>Performing to Outperforming (High-Performance)</strong>: The leap from performing to outperforming is achieved by exceeding expectations consistently. It&#x27;s vital to maintain the momentum, continuously innovate, and strive for improvement. Commitment to the team&#x27;s shared vision and purpose, trust among team members, and open communication are crucial factors in this stage. The team should also be flexible in adapting to changes and challenges and should be driven to continually improve their performance.</li>

<p>Team Personal Presentations is an exercise where each team member creates a short presentation about themselves to share with the rest of the team. This can include information about their background, interests, strengths, weaknesses, and even fun facts. The goal is to allow team members to get to know each other on a deeper level, beyond just their professional roles.</p>
<p>This exercise can help to build stronger relationships within the team, foster empathy and understanding, and improve team cohesion. It gives team members an insight into who their colleagues really are, which can lead to greater trust, better communication, and a more effective working environment.</p>

<p>The Moving Motivators exercise is a tool from Management 3.0 that helps in understanding the intrinsic motivations of individuals within a team. It involves a deck of ten cards, each representing a key motivator such as acceptance, curiosity, freedom, or power.</p>
<p>The participant orders these cards in order of personal importance. Then, they consider a recent change in their work or life and move the cards up or down based on whether this change has positively or negatively impacted each motivator. This provides valuable insights into what drives a person and how changes affect their motivation, which is crucial for effective team management and leadership.</p>

<p>The Team Health Check is an exercise developed by Spotify to assess the health of their teams.</p>
<p>Teams collectively assess how they are doing on several aspects, such as collaboration, value delivery, mission, fun, learning, and leadership. Each team member votes on each aspect using a traffic light system (green for good, yellow for okay, red for not good).</p>
<p>The results are then discussed openly, helping to facilitate communication about challenges, improvements, and actions to be taken. The exercise is not about blaming or pointing fingers but about understanding and improving team dynamics and performance.</p>

<p>Most companies employ these steps as filters, aiming to discover the “ideal candidate” with the least possible commitment. This turns the hiring process into a lengthy, high-effort endeavor that can span multiple months. As you can see, from application to hire, we&#x27;re looking at an average of 32 days and a time investment of 15.5 hours.</p>
<p>In competitive markets—such as the one I&#x27;m familiar with—the top candidates are often hired within a maximum of two weeks after applying for a job. How can this be?</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-issue-at-hand">The Issue at hand<a href="#the-issue-at-hand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Issue at hand" title="Direct link to The Issue at hand">​</a></h2>
<p>Over-engineering can be pinpointed as the root cause of the issue.</p>
<p>Here are the three main concerns that lead to this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Avoidance Leads to Over-Complication:</strong> Trying to avoid any slip-ups during the hiring process often results in a complicated and lengthy procedure. This method is more about reducing the risk of a bad hire, even if it sacrifices speed and efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Fear of Overlooking the Perfect Candidate:</strong> The worry of not finding that potentially perfect candidate leads to an exhaustive process. Every candidate is meticulously screened at each stage, lengthening the hiring period.</li>
<li><strong>Concern Over Wasting Employee Time:</strong> The fear of spending current employee time on unsuccessful hiring processes is a worry. This concern stems from knowing that time is valuable, especially in fast-paced work environments. If the hiring process doesn&#x27;t yield a successful hire, it&#x27;s considered a misuse of employee time that could have been used for immediate needs and goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, lengthy processes are the embodiment of these fears. The rationale is straightforward: the top candidates are often the first to be snapped up. If your hiring process is sluggish due to numerous feedback loops, chances are you&#x27;re missing out on top-tier talent.</p>
<p>Remember, most companies aren&#x27;t engaged in rocket science, which means you probably don&#x27;t need a rocket scientist on your team. What you do need are team players who can collaborate effectively and add value to your product.</p>

<p>To attract and secure top-tier talent in a fast and efficient manner, it is imperative to streamline and reform our hiring process.</p>
<p>The objective is to create a process that is not only efficient in its operations, but also effective in securing the best possible talent for our teams. This approach must consider the existing challenges in the hiring process and devise solutions that counter these issues, while optimizing for speed and quality of hires.</p>
<p>To facilitate such transformation in the hiring process, we need to undertake the following steps:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="simplify-evaluation-process">Simplify Evaluation Process<a href="#simplify-evaluation-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Simplify Evaluation Process" title="Direct link to Simplify Evaluation Process">​</a></h3>
<p>The prevailing approach in many companies operates like a wishlist, confirming that candidates meet an extensive set of expectations. However, these wishlists often become an endless array of checkboxes that candidates must tick off.</p>
<p>A more efficient solution would be to invert this evaluation method, implementing a flagging system to identify what is unacceptable in a candidate. This method streamlines the process, as it&#x27;s a true or false evaluation where we all have the same expectation. Instead of having a checklist of 100 items that can have different readings by the evaluator to be covered in 2 to 4 technically focused interviews, we&#x27;re able to identify any red flags in just one or two interviews.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see examples that I have seen in real life:</p>

<p>In line with product development, minimizing feedback loops can enhance agility.</p>
<p>Inserting filters into the process simply creates delay in decision-making, as feedback must be revisited before proceeding. These waiting periods regularly lead to candidates disengaging from the process.</p>
<p>Moreover, these filters may inadvertently prevent a potential candidate from showcasing their full potential in later stages of the process, frequently leading to premature dismissal of suitable candidates for the position.</p>
<p>Eliminating filters from feedback loops can accelerate the process and lessen the burden on our existing employees. By removing reporting for future steps and not discarding candidates early, candidate success rate will increase, resulting in fewer interviews in the long run.</p>

<p>From a young age, we&#x27;re taught the value of steady, incremental progress. The idea is that like a determined tortoise, we can reach our goals by moving deliberately in the right direction. But could there be a more efficient approach?</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-comfort-zone-a-default-state">The Comfort Zone a Default State<a href="#the-comfort-zone-a-default-state" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Comfort Zone a Default State" title="Direct link to The Comfort Zone a Default State">​</a></h2>
<p>It&#x27;s widely recognized that individuals typically operate within their comfort zones. But what exactly is the comfort zone? Here&#x27;s a potential definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The comfort zone refers to a psychological state in which one feels familiar, safe, and at ease. It is the area of experience where a person operates in an anxiety-neutral condition, using a limited set of behaviors to deliver a steady level of performance, usually without any sense of risk or need for change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sticking to what&#x27;s familiar can often deter us from making significant strides in improving our lives. More often than not, we choose minor, incremental changes that don&#x27;t veer too far from our routine.</p>
<p>This fondness for comfort zones isn&#x27;t just personal—it extends into software development practices and product development too. Frequently, teams would rather make minor adjustments than take the risk of adopting an entirely new approach. This could be due to fear of failure, resistance to change, or simply not being aware of the potential benefits of a different approach.</p>
<p>Sure, these incremental changes are easier to manage and implement. They cause less disruption to our current systems and processes, letting us maintain stability and make small steps forward. But, they can also restrict our potential for innovation and growth. When we only focus on baby steps, we might overlook the chance to make a big leap that could bring about significant benefits.</p>
<p>This leads us to ask: Are these small improvements enough? Do they truly meet the needs of the team and the organization, or are they simply a safe and comfortable route that leads to average results?</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="signs-of-need-for-change">Signs of Need For change<a href="#signs-of-need-for-change" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Signs of Need For change" title="Direct link to Signs of Need For change">​</a></h2>
<p>Let&#x27;s consider some signs that may indicate the presence of comfort zones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stalled Progress</strong>: If we see little to no significant progress over a lengthy period, it could mean our team might be tweaking things without making a real impact. In this case, the next level of improvement could be further than anticipated.</li>
<li><strong>Reluctance towards new ideas</strong>: A quick dismissal or resistance to new suggestions can indicate a deep-rooted reluctance to change. This resistance is often due to the comfort of the familiar, fear of the unknown, and potential risks associated with change.</li>
<li><strong>Unchanging strategies</strong>: If we find ourselves continually resorting to the same solutions or minor variations of past strategies, it suggests that we&#x27;re stuck in a comfort zone. A hesitation to try new approaches, especially when facing repetitive challenges, signals a comfort zone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, it&#x27;s crucial to continually assess your team&#x27;s adaptability. If there are signs of stagnation, resistance to change, or a lack of creative problem-solving, it may be time to challenge the comfort zone and think about making more substantial changes instead of small, incremental ones.</p>
<p>If you are already measuring the behavior, you will notice comfort zones can be represented as logarithmic functions.</p>

<p>Recognizing the need for change is just the beginning. Here&#x27;s how we can pave the way forward:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Spot key metrics</strong>: Initiate by spotting key metrics that accurately represent the area you&#x27;re aiming to enhance. These metrics should be specific, measurable, and directly tied to the performance or behavior you&#x27;re looking to improve.</li>
<li><strong>Gauge the current situation</strong>: Use these as a benchmark to contrast your future performance and evaluate the progress of your initiative.</li>
<li><strong>Set a North Star</strong>: Set a clear, ambitious yet attainable goal that will steer your efforts. This goal should push your team to step out of their comfort zone, but still be within reach. Ensure this goal is in line with your wider business objectives and resonates with your team members, providing them a strong incentive to aim for the initiative.</li>
<li><strong>Estimate the gap</strong>: Evaluate the difference between your current performance and your North Star. This is the distance your team needs to traverse to achieve the desired improvement. Understanding this gap will give you a clear sense of the scope of the change required and will help shape your strategy for the initiative.</li>
<li><strong>Plan the change</strong>: Having defined your key metrics and North Star, begin plotting the course required for the initiative. You will be faced with 2 options:<!-- -->
<ol>
<li><strong>Bold Move</strong>: Occasionally, a significant departure from the current state to your ultimate goal is necessary. Always consider this as your primary option.</li>
<li><strong>Gradual Progress</strong>: If the change appears overwhelming or too abrupt, reduce it by taking smaller steps towards your ultimate goal.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Review and Refine</strong>: Continually track your progress and compare it to your initial benchmark. Use this information to fine-tune your approach, adjust your strategy, and implement necessary modifications.</li>
</ol>

<p>It&#x27;s crucial to remember that change is not always easy, but it&#x27;s often necessary for growth. Incremental improvements have their place, but occasionally, we need to take confident leaps to truly innovate and realize our full potential. By willing to step outside our comfort zones, we open ourselves up to new possibilities and opportunities for improvement. Next time you&#x27;re with your team, ponder over these topics. It&#x27;s vital to identify your guiding star to reach it.
For example, consider this in the context of your team&#x27;s productivity. What practices could make you the most efficient team? For me, the answer was Extreme Programming (XP). You might contemplate a significant shift from individual development with pull requests to mob programming, and smaller steps towards adopting Trunk-Based Development due to the need for additional tools.</p>
<p>Also, don&#x27;t hesitate to think creatively about product development. For instance, we often have to shift Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to meet Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), like increasing the lead conversion percentage. If the leap percentage is high, you might need to implement revolutionary new strategies, rather than sticking with the status quo.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><iframe src="https://scalinghorizons.substack.com/embed" width="100%" height="150" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><footer class="theme-layout-footer footer"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="theme-layout-footer-column col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Connect</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="mailto:contact@alvarolorente.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Email me<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alvarolorentedev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">LinkedIn<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.github.com/alvarolorentedev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Github<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/alvarolorentede" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="theme-layout-footer-column col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Discover</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/">About me</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/services">Services</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/projects">Projects</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/talks">Talks</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://leadshorizons.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Newsletter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2023-2025 Alvaro Lorente.</div></div></div></footer></div>
